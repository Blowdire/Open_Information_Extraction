 Chapter 1 
 A LONG - EXPECTED PARTY 
 When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that Baggins would shortly be celebrating Baggins eleventy - first birthday with a party of special magnificence , there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton . 
 Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar , and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years , ever since Bilbo remarkable disappearance and unexpected return . The riches Bilbo had brought back from Bilbo travels had now become a local legend , and it was popularly believed , whatever the old folk might say , that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure . And if that was not enough for fame , there was also Bilbo prolonged vigour to marvel at . Time wore on , but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins . At ninety Bilbo was much the same as at fifty . At ninety - nine fifty began to call Bilbo well - preserved ; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark . There were some that shook fifty heads and thought this was too much of a good thing ; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess ( apparently ) perpetual youth as well as ( reputedly ) inexhaustible wealth . 
 ‘ anyone will have to be paid for , ’ fifty said . ‘ anyone is n’t natural , and trouble will come of anyone ! ’ 
 But so far trouble had not come ; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with Baggins money , most people were willing to forgive Baggins Baggins oddities and Baggins good fortune . Baggins remained on visiting terms with Baggins relatives ( except , of course , the Sackville - Bagginses ) , and Baggins had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families . But Baggins had no close friends , until some of Baggins younger cousins began to grow up . 
 The eldest of these , and Bilbo ’s favourite , was young Frodo Baggins . When Bilbo was ninety - nine Bilbo adopted Frodo as Bilbo heir , and brought Frodo to live at Bag End ; and the hopes of the Sackville - Bagginses were finally dashed . Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday , September 22nd . ‘ You had better come and live here , Frodo my lad , ’ said Bilbo one day ; ‘ and then we can celebrate our birthday - parties comfortably together . ’ At that time Frodo was still in Frodo tweens , as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty - three . 
 Twelve more years passed . Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday - parties at Bag End ; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn . Bilbo was going to be eleventy - one , 111 , a rather curious number , and a very respectable age for a hobbit ( the Old Took Old had only reached 130 ) ; and Frodo was going to be thirty - three , 33 , an important number : the date of Frodo ‘ coming of age ’ . 
 Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater ; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire . The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation ; and the older folk suddenly found history reminiscences in welcome demand . 
 No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee , commonly known as the Gaffer . Gamgee held forth at The Ivy Bush , a small inn on the Bywater road ; and Gamgee spoke with some authority , for Gamgee had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years , and had helped old Holman in the same job before that . Now that Gamgee was Gamgee growing old and stiff in the joints , the job was mainly carried on by Gamgee youngest son , Sam Gamgee . Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo . father lived on the Hill Hill , in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End . 
 ‘ A very nice well - spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo , as I ’ve always said , ’ the Gaffer declared . With perfect truth : for Bilbo was very polite to Row , calling Row ‘ Master Hamfast ’ , and consulting Row constantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘ roots ’ , especially potatoes , the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood ( including authority ) . 
 ‘ But what about this Frodo that lives with Frodo ? ’ asked Old Noakes of Bywater . ‘ Baggins is Baggins name , but Baggins ’s more than half a Brandybuck , name say . Brandybuck beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland , where folks are so queer . ’ 
 ‘ And no wonder folks ’re queer , ’ put in Daddy Twofoot ( the Gaffer ’s next - door neighbour ) , ‘ if folks live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River , and right agin the Old Forest . That ’s a dark bad place , if half the tales be true . ’ 
 ‘ You ’re right , Dad ! ’ said the Gaffer . ‘ Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live in the Old Forest ; but tales ’re a queer breed , seemingly . tales fool about with boats on that big river – and that is n’t natural . Small wonder that trouble came of wonder , I say . But be that as wonder may , Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet . Very much like Mr. Bilbo , and in more than looks . After all Bilbo father was a Baggins . A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins ; there was never much to tell of Bilbo , till Bilbo was drownded . ’ 
 ‘ Drownded ? ’ said several voices . voices had heard this and other darker rumours before , of course ; but hobbits have a passion for family history , and hobbits were ready to hear passion again . 
 ‘ Well , so father say , ’ said the Gaffer . ‘ You see : Mr. Drogo , Drogo married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck . Brandybuck was our Mr. Bilbo ’s first cousin on the mother ’s side ( Brandybuck mother being the youngest of the Old Took ’s daughters ) ; and Mr. Drogo was Drogo second cousin . So Mr. Frodo is Drogo first and second cousin , once removed either way , as the saying is , if you follow me . And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with Drogo father - in - law , old Master Gorbadoc , as Drogo often did after Drogo marriage ( Drogo being partial to Drogo vittles , and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table ) ; and Drogo went out boating on the Brandywine River ; and Drogo and Drogo wife were drownded , and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all . ’ 
 ‘ I ’ve heard vittles went on the water after dinner in the moonlight , ’ said Old Noakes ; ‘ and it was Drogo ’s weight as sunk the boat . ’ 
 ‘ And I heard Gorbadoc pushed he in , and he pulled Gorbadoc in after Drogo , ’ said Sandyman , the Hobbiton miller . 
 ‘ You should n’t listen to all you hear , Sandyman , ’ said the Gaffer , who did not much like the miller . ‘ There is n’t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling . Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble . Anyway : there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded , as you might say , among those queer Bucklanders , being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall . A regular warren , by all accounts . Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place . Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when Bilbo brought the lad back to live among decent folk . 
 ‘ But I reckon deed was a nasty knock for those Sackville - Bagginses . relations thought relations were going to get Bag End , that time when Bilbo went off and was thought to be dead . And then Bilbo comes back and orders relations off ; and Bilbo goes on living and living , and never looking a day older , bless lad ! And suddenly lad produces an heir , and has all the papers made out proper . The Sackville - Bagginses wo n’t never see the inside of Bag End now , or it is to be hoped not . ’ 
 ‘ There ’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there , I hear tell , ’ said a stranger , a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing . ‘ All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver , and jools , by what I ’ve heard . ’ 
 ‘ Then you ’ve heard more than I can speak to , ’ answered the Gaffer . ‘ I know nothing about jools . Mr. Bilbo is free with Bilbo money , and there seems no lack of money ; but I know of no tunnel - making . I saw Mr. Bilbo when Bilbo came back , a matter of sixty years ago , when I was a lad . I ’d not long come prentice to old Holman ( prentice being my dad ’s cousin ) , but prentice had me up at Bag End helping prentice to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on . And in the middle of garden all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests . I do n’t doubt pony were mostly full of treasure Bilbo had picked up in foreign parts , where there be mountains of gold , pony say ; but there was n’t enough to fill tunnels . But my lad Sam will know more about that . lad ’s in and out of Bag End . Crazy about stories of the old days , lad is , and lad listens to all Mr. Bilbo ’s tales . Mr. Bilbo has learned lad lad letters – meaning no harm , mark you , and I hope no harm will come of harm . 
 ‘ Elves and Dragons ! I says to lad . Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you . Do n’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters , or you ’ll land in trouble too big for you , I says to lad . And I might say trouble to others , ’ lad added with a look at the stranger and the miller . 
 But the Gaffer did not convince lad audience . The legend of Bilbo ’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits . 
 ‘ Ah , but lad has likely enough been adding to what lad brought at first , ’ argued the miller , voicing common opinion . ‘ lad ’s often away from home . And look at the outlandish folk that visit lad : dwarves coming at night , and that old wandering conjuror , Gandalf , and all . You can say what you like , Gaffer , but Bag End ’s a queer place , and place folk are queerer . ’ 
 ‘ And you can say what you like , about what you know no more of than you do of boating , Mr. Sandyman , ’ retorted the Gaffer , disliking the miller even more than usual . ‘ If that ’s being queer , then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts . There ’s some not far away that would n’t offer a pint of beer to a friend , if friend lived in a hole with golden walls . But friend do things proper at Bag End . Our Sam says that everyone ’s going to be invited to the party , and there ’s going to be presents , mark you , presents for all – this very month as is . ’ 
 That very month was September , and as fine as you could ask . A day or two later a rumour ( probably started by the knowledgeable Sam ) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks – fireworks , what is more , such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century , not indeed since the Old Took died . 
 Days passed and The Day drew nearer . An odd - looking waggon laden with odd - looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End . The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at Hobbiton . It was driven by outlandish folk , singing strange songs : dwarves with long beards and deep hoods . A few of dwarves remained at Bag End . At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight . An old man was driving cart all alone . man wore a tall pointed blue hat , a long grey cloak , and a silver scarf . man had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of man hat . Small hobbit - children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill . Hobbiton had a cargo of fireworks , as fireworks rightly guessed . At Bilbo ’s front door the old Bilbo began to unload : there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes , each labelled with a large red G and the elf - rune , . 
 That was Gandalf ’s mark , of course , and the old Gandalf was Gandalf the Wizard , whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to Wizard skill with fires , smokes , and lights . Wizard real business was far more difficult and dangerous , but the Shire - folk knew nothing about business . To fires Wizard was just one of the ‘ attractions ’ at the Party . Hence the excitement of the hobbit - children . ‘ G for Grand ! ’ fires shouted , and the old man smiled . fires knew man by sight , though man only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long ; but neither fires nor any but the oldest of fires elders had seen one of man firework displays – fires now belonged to a legendary past . 
 When the old man , helped by Bilbo and some dwarves , had finished unloading , Bilbo gave a few pennies away ; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming , to the disappointment of the onlookers . 
 ‘ Run away now ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ You will get plenty when the time comes . ’ Then Gandalf disappeared inside with Bilbo , and the door was shut . The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while , and then made off , feeling that the day of the party would never come . 
 Inside Bag End , Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden . The late afternoon was bright and peaceful . The flowers glowed red and golden : snap - dragons and sunflowers , and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows . 
 ‘ How bright your garden looks ! ’ said Gandalf . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ I am very fond indeed of garden , and of all the dear old Shire ; but I think I need a holiday . ’ 
 ‘ You mean to go on with your plan then ? ’ 
 ‘ I do . I made up my mind months ago , and I have n’t changed mind . ’ 
 ‘ Very well . It is no good saying any more . Stick to your plan – your whole plan , mind – and I hope plan will turn out for the best , for you , and for all of us . ’ 
 ‘ I hope so . Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday , and have my little joke . ’ 
 ‘ Who will laugh , I wonder ? ’ said Gandalf , shaking Gandalf head . 
 ‘ We shall see , ’ said Bilbo . 
 The next day more carts rolled up the Hill , and still more carts . There might have been some grumbling about ‘ dealing locally ’ , but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision , commodity , or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood . People became enthusiastic ; and People began to tick off the days on the calendar ; and People watched eagerly for the postman , hoping for invitations . 
 Before long the invitations began pouring out , and the Hobbiton post - office was blocked , and the Bywater post - office was snowed under , and voluntary assistant postmen were called for . There was a constant stream of postmen going up the Hill , carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you , I shall certainly come . 
 A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End : NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS . Even those who had , or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside . Bilbo was busy : writing invitations , ticking off answers , packing up presents , and making some private preparations of Bilbo own . From the time of Gandalf ’s arrival Bilbo remained hidden from view . 
 One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field , south of Bilbo ’s front door , covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions . A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road , and wide steps and a large white gate were built there . The three hobbit - families of Bagshot Row , adjoining the field , were intensely interested and generally envied . Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in Gamgee garden . 
 The tents began to go up . There was a specially large pavilion , so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside pavilion , and stood proudly near one end , at the head of the chief table . Lanterns were hung on all pavilion branches . More promising still ( to the hobbits ’ mind ): an enormous open - air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field . A draught of cooks , from every inn and eating - house for miles around , arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End . Excitement rose to Excitement height . 
 Then the weather clouded over . That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party . Anxiety was intense . Then Thursday , September the 22nd , actually dawned . The sun got up , the clouds vanished , flags were unfurled and the fun began . 
 Bilbo Baggins called fun a party , but fun was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one . Practically everybody living near was invited . A very few were overlooked by accident , but as party turned up all the same , that did not matter . Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked ; and there were even a few from outside the borders . Bilbo met the guests ( and additions ) at the new white gate in person . Bilbo gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate . Hobbits give presents to other people on Hobbits own birthdays . Not very expensive ones , as a rule , and not so lavishly as on this occasion ; but rule was not a bad system . Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was somebody ’s birthday , so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week . But parts never got tired of Hobbiton . 
 On this occasion the presents were unusually good . The hobbit - children were so excited that for a while children almost forgot about eating . There were toys the like of which children had never seen before , all beautiful and some obviously magical . Many of children had indeed been ordered a year before , and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale , and were of real dwarf - make . 
 When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate , there were songs , dances , music , games , and , of course , food and drink . There were three official meals : lunch , tea , and dinner ( or supper ) . But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together . At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking – continuously from elevenses until six - thirty , when the fireworks started . 
 The fireworks were by Gandalf : fireworks were not only brought by Dale , but designed and made by Dale ; and the special effects , set pieces , and flights of rockets were let off by Dale . But there was also a generous distribution of squibs , crackers , backarappers , sparklers , torches , dwarf - candles , elf - fountains , goblin - barkers and thunder - claps . squibs were all superb . The art of Gandalf improved with age . 
 There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices . There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke : trees leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment , and trees shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits , disappearing with a sweet scent just before trees touched trees upturned faces . There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees ; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles , or sailing ships , or a phalanx of flying swans ; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain ; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army , and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes . And there was also one last surprise , in honour of Bilbo , and surprise startled the hobbits exceedingly , as Gandalf intended . The lights went out . A great smoke went up . smoke shaped smoke like a mountain seen in the distance , and began to glow at the summit . smoke spouted green and scarlet flames . Out flew a red - golden dragon – not life - size , but terribly life - like : fire came from dragon jaws , dragon eyes glared down ; there was a roar , and dragon whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd . eyes all ducked , and many fell flat on eyes faces . The dragon passed like an express train , turned a somersault , and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion . 
 ‘ That is the signal for supper ! ’ said Bilbo . The pain and alarm vanished at once , and the prostrate hobbits leaped to hobbits feet . There was a splendid supper for everyone ; for everyone , that is , except those invited to the special family dinner - party . This was held in the great pavilion with the tree . The invitations were limited to twelve dozen ( a number also called by the hobbits one Gross , though the word was not considered proper to use of people ) ; and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related , with the addition of a few special unrelated friends ( such as Gandalf ) . Many young hobbits were included , and present by parental permission ; for hobbits were easy - going with hobbits children in the matter of sitting up late , especially when there was a chance of getting hobbits a free meal . Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender . 
 There were many Bagginses and Boffins , and also many Tooks and Brandybucks ; there were various Grubbs ( relations of Bilbo Baggins ’ grandmother ) , and various Chubbs ( connexions of Baggins Took grandfather ) ; and a selection of Burrowses , Bolgers , Bracegirdles , Brockhouses , Goodbodies , Hornblowers and Proudfoots . Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo , and some had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before , as some lived in remote corners of the Shire . The Sackville - Bagginses were not forgotten . Otho and Otho wife Lobelia were present . Otho disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo , but so magnificent was the invitation card , written in golden ink , that Otho had felt card was impossible to refuse . Besides , Otho cousin , Bilbo , had been specializing in food for many years and cousin table had a high reputation . 
 All the one hundred and forty - four guests expected a pleasant feast ; though guests rather dreaded the after - dinner speech of guests host ( an inevitable item ) . cousin was liable to drag in bits of what cousin called poetry ; and sometimes , after a glass or two , would allude to the absurd adventures of cousin mysterious journey . The guests were not disappointed : guests had a very pleasant feast , in fact an engrossing entertainment : rich , abundant , varied , and prolonged . The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks ; but as Bilbo ’s catering had depleted the stocks of most of the stores , cellars and warehouses for miles around , that did not matter much . 
 After the feast ( more or less ) came the Speech . Most of the company were , however , now in a tolerant mood , at that delightful stage which company called ‘ filling up the corners ’ . company were sipping company favourite drinks , and nibbling at company favourite dainties , and company fears were forgotten . company were prepared to listen to anything , and to cheer at every full stop . 
 My dear People , began Bilbo , rising in Bilbo place . ‘ Hear ! Hear ! Hear ! ’ company shouted , and kept on repeating it in chorus , seeming reluctant to follow company own advice . Bilbo left Bilbo place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree . The light of the lanterns fell on Bilbo beaming face ; the golden buttons shone on Bilbo embroidered silk waistcoat . buttons could all see Bilbo standing , waving one hand in the air , the other was in Bilbo trouser - pocket . 
 My dear Bagginses and Boffins , Bilbo began again ; and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks , and Grubbs , and Chubbs , and Burrowses , and Hornblowers , and Bolgers , Bracegirdles , Goodbodies , Brockhouses and Proudfoots . ‘ ProudFEET ! ’ shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion . Bilbo name , of course , was Proudfoot , and well merited ; Bilbo feet were large , exceptionally furry , and both were on the table . 
 Proudfoots , repeated Bilbo . Also my good Sackville - Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End . Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday : I am eleventy - one today ! ‘ Hurray ! Hurray ! Many Happy Returns ! ’ Bagginses shouted , and Bagginses hammered joyously on the tables . Bilbo was doing splendidly . This was the sort of stuff Bagginses liked : short and obvious . 
 I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am . Deafening cheers . Cries of Yes ( and No ) . Noises of trumpets and horns , pipes and flutes , and other musical instruments . There were , as has been said , many young hobbits present . Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled . Most of crackers bore the mark dale on crackers ; which did not convey much to most of the hobbits , but crackers all agreed crackers were marvellous crackers . crackers contained instruments , small , but of perfect make and enchanting tones . Indeed , in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks , supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished ( since Bilbo had plainly said all that was necessary ) , now got up an impromptu orchestra , and began a merry dance - tune . Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in Took hands began to dance the Springle - ring : a pretty dance , but rather vigorous . 
 But Bilbo had not finished . Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby , Bilbo blew three loud hoots . The noise subsided . I shall not keep you long , Bilbo cried . Cheers from all the assembly . I have called you all together for a Purpose . Something in the way that Bilbo said this made an impression . There was almost silence , and one or two of the Tooks pricked up one ears . 
 Indeed , for Three Purposes ! First of all , to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all , and that eleventy - one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits . Tremendous outburst of approval . 
 I do n’t know half of you half as well as I should like ; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve . This was unexpected and rather difficult . There was some scattered clapping , but most of half were trying to work clapping out and see if clapping came to a compliment . 
 Secondly , to celebrate my birthday . Cheers again . I should say : OUR birthday . For clapping is , of course , also the birthday of my heir and nephew , Frodo . nephew comes of age and into nephew inheritance today . Some perfunctory clapping by the elders ; and some loud shouts of ‘ Frodo ! Frodo ! Jolly old Frodo , ’ from the juniors . The Sackville - Bagginses scowled , and wondered what was meant by ‘ coming into nephew inheritance ’ . 
 Together we score one hundred and forty - four . Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total : One Gross , if I may use the expression . No cheers . This was ridiculous . Many of the guests , and especially the Sackville - Bagginses , were insulted , feeling sure guests had only been asked to fill up the required number , like goods in a package . ‘ One Gross , indeed ! Vulgar expression . ’ 
 It is also , if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history , the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake ; though the fact that fact was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion . I was only fifty - one then , and birthdays did not seem so important . The banquet was very splendid , however , though I had a bad cold at the time , I remember , and could only say ‘ thag you very buch ’ . I now repeat banquet more correctly : Thank you very much for coming to my little party . Obstinate silence . birthdays all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent ; and birthdays were getting bored . Why could n’t party stop talking and let birthdays drink party health ? But Bilbo did not sing or recite . Bilbo paused for a moment . 
 Thirdly and finally , Bilbo said , I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT . Bilbo spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could . I regret to announce that – though , as I said , eleventy - one years is far too short a time to spend among you – this is the END . I am going . I am leaving NOW . GOOD - BYE ! 
 Bilbo stepped down and vanished . There was a blinding flash of light , and the guests all blinked . When guests opened guests eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen . One hundred and forty - four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless . Old Odo Proudfoot removed Bilbo feet from the table and stamped . Then there was a dead silence , until suddenly , after several deep breaths , every Baggins , Boffin , Took , Brandybuck , Grubb , Chubb , Burrows , Bolger , Bracegirdle , Brockhouse , Goodbody , Hornblower , and Proudfoot began to talk at once . 
 It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste , and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance . ‘ annoyance ’s mad . I always said so , ’ was probably the most popular comment . Even the Tooks ( with a few exceptions ) thought Bilbo ’s behaviour was absurd . For the moment most of exceptions took behaviour for granted that Bilbo disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank . 
 But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure . Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded Brandybuck wits , and Brandybuck said to Brandybuck daughter - in - law , Esmeralda : ‘ There ’s something fishy in this , my dear ! I believe that mad Baggins is off again . Silly old fool . But why worry ? Baggins has n’t taken the vittles with fool . ’ Brandybuck called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again . 
 Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing . For some time Brandybuck had sat silent beside Bilbo ’s empty chair , and ignored all remarks and questions . Brandybuck had enjoyed the joke , of course , even though Brandybuck had been in the know . Brandybuck had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests . But at the same time Brandybuck felt deeply troubled : Brandybuck realized suddenly that Brandybuck loved the old hobbit dearly . Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins ’ oddities , past and present ; but the Sackville - Bagginses had already departed in wrath . Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party . Frodo gave orders for more wine to be served ; then Frodo got up and drained Frodo own glass silently to the health of Bilbo , and slipped out of the pavilion . 
 As for Bilbo Baggins , even while Baggins was making Baggins speech , Baggins had been fingering the golden ring in Baggins pocket : Baggins magic ring that Baggins had kept secret for so many years . As Baggins stepped down Baggins slipped pocket on Baggins finger , and Baggins was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again . 
 Baggins walked briskly back to Baggins hole , and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion , and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field . Then Baggins went in . Baggins took off Baggins party clothes , folded up and wrapped in tissue - paper Baggins embroidered silk waistcoat , and put waistcoat away . Then Baggins put on quickly some old untidy garments , and fastened round Baggins waist a worn leather belt . On waistcoat Baggins hung a short sword in a battered black - leather scabbard . From a locked drawer , smelling of moth - balls , Baggins took out an old cloak and hood . balls had been locked up as if balls were very precious , but balls were so patched and weatherstained that balls original colour could hardly be guessed : it might have been dark green . balls were rather too large for Baggins . Baggins then went into Baggins study , and from a large strong - box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths , and a leather - bound manuscript ; and also a large bulky envelope . The book and bundle Baggins stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there , already nearly full . Into the envelope Baggins slipped Baggins golden ring , and ring fine chain , and then sealed ring , and addressed ring to Frodo . At first Baggins put ring on the mantelpiece , but suddenly Baggins removed ring and stuck ring in Baggins pocket . At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in . 
 ‘ Hullo ! ’ said Bilbo . ‘ I wondered if you would turn up . ’ 
 ‘ I am glad to find you visible , ’ replied the wizard , sitting down in a chair , ‘ I wanted to catch you and have a few final words . I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , I do , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ Though that flash was surprising : flash quite startled me , let alone the others . A little addition of your own , I suppose ? ’ 
 ‘ flash was . You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years , and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment . ’ 
 ‘ And would spoil my joke . You are an interfering old busybody , ’ laughed Bilbo , ‘ but I expect you know best , as usual . ’ 
 ‘ I do – when I know anything . But I do n’t feel too sure about this whole affair . affair has now come to the final point . You have had your joke , and alarmed or offended most of your relations , and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days , or ninety - nine more likely . Are you going any further ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , I am . I feel I need a holiday , a very long holiday , as I have told you before . Probably a permanent holiday : I do n’t expect I shall return . In fact , I do n’t mean to , and I have made all arrangements . 
 ‘ I am old , Gandalf . I do n’t look holiday , but I am beginning to feel holiday in my heart of hearts . Well - preserved indeed ! ’ he snorted . ‘ Why , I feel all thin , sort of stretched , if you know what I mean : like butter that has been scraped over too much bread . That ca n’t be right . I need a change , or something . ’ 
 Gandalf looked curiously and closely at he . ‘ No , it does not seem right , ’ Gandalf said thoughtfully . ‘ No , after all I believe your plan is probably the best . ’ 
 ‘ Well , I ’ve made up my mind , anyway . I want to see mountains again , Gandalf – mountains ; and then find somewhere where I can rest . In peace and quiet , without a lot of relatives prying around , and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell . I might find somewhere where I can finish my book . I have thought of a nice ending for book : and mind lived happily ever after to the end of mind days . ’ 
 Gandalf laughed . ‘ I hope Gandalf will . But nobody will read the book , however book ends . ’ 
 ‘ Oh , nobody may , in years to come . Frodo has read some already , as far as some has gone . You ’ll keep an eye on Frodo , wo n’t you ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , I will – two eyes , as often as I can spare eyes . ’ 
 ‘ Frodo would come with me , of course , if I asked Frodo . In fact Frodo offered to once , just before the party . But party does not really want to , yet . I want to see the wild country again before I die , and the Mountains ; but party is still in love with the Shire , with woods and fields and little rivers . party ought to be comfortable here . I am leaving everything to party , of course , except a few oddments . I hope party will be happy , when party gets used to being on party own . course ’s time party was party own master now . ’ 
 ‘ Everything ? ’ said Gandalf . ‘ The ring as well ? You agreed to that , you remember . ’ 
 ‘ Well , er , yes , I suppose so , ’ stammered Bilbo . ‘ Where is Well ? ’ 
 ‘ In an envelope , if you must know , ’ said Bilbo impatiently . ‘ There on the mantelpiece . Well , no ! Here mantelpiece is in my pocket ! ’ Bilbo hesitated . ‘ Is n’t that odd now ? ’ Bilbo said softly to Bilbo . ‘ Yet after all , why not ? Why should n’t mantelpiece stay there ? ’ 
 Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo , and there was a gleam in Bilbo eyes . ‘ I think , Bilbo , ’ Bilbo said quietly , ‘ I should leave mantelpiece behind . Do n’t you want to ? ’ 
 ‘ Well yes – and no . Now mantelpiece comes to Gandalf , I do n’t like parting with Gandalf at all , I may say . And I do n’t really see why I should . Why do you want me to ? ’ Bilbo asked , and a curious change came over Bilbo voice . change was sharp with suspicion and annoyance . ‘ You are always badgering me about my ring ; but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey . ’ 
 ‘ No , but I had to badger you , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ I wanted the truth . truth was important . Magic rings are – well , magical ; and rings are rare and curious . I was professionally interested in your ring , you may say ; and I still am . I should like to know where it is , if you go wandering again . Also I think you have had truth quite long enough . You wo n’t need truth any more , Bilbo , unless I am quite mistaken . ’ 
 Bilbo flushed , and there was an angry light in Bilbo eyes . Bilbo kindly face grew hard . ‘ Why not ? ’ Bilbo cried . ‘ And what business is it of yours , anyway , to know what I do with my own things ? business is my own . I found business . business came to me . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , yes , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But there is no need to get angry . ’ 
 ‘ If I am need is your fault , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ need is mine , I tell you . My own . My Precious . Yes , my Precious . ’ 
 The wizard ’s face remained grave and attentive , and only a flicker in wizard deep eyes showed that wizard was startled and indeed alarmed . ‘ need has been called that before , ’ wizard said , ‘ but not by you . ’ 
 ‘ But I say need now . And why not ? Even if Gollum said the same once . need ’s not Gollum now , but mine . And I shall keep need , I say . ’ 
 Gandalf stood up . Gandalf spoke sternly . ‘ You will be a fool if you do , Bilbo , ’ Gollum said . ‘ You make that clearer with every word you say . that has got far too much hold on you . Let that go ! And then you can go yourself , and be free . ’ 
 ‘ I ’ll do as I choose and go as I please , ’ said Bilbo obstinately . 
 ‘ Now , now , my dear hobbit ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ All your long life we have been friends , and you owe me something . Come ! Do as you promised : give life up ! ’ 
 ‘ Well , if you want my ring yourself , say so ! ’ cried Bilbo . ‘ But you wo n’t get life . I wo n’t give my Precious away , I tell you . ’ Bilbo hand strayed to the hilt of Bilbo small sword . 
 Gandalf ’s eyes flashed . ‘ It will be my turn to get angry soon , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ If you say that again , I shall . Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked . ’ Bilbo took a step towards the hobbit , and Bilbo seemed to grow tall and menacing ; Bilbo shadow filled the little room . 
 Bilbo backed away to the wall , breathing hard , Bilbo hand clutching at Bilbo pocket . hand stood for a while facing one another , and the air of the room tingled . Gandalf ’s eyes remained bent on the hobbit . Slowly Gandalf hands relaxed , and Gandalf began to tremble . 
 ‘ I do n’t know what has come over you , Gandalf , ’ Gandalf said . ‘ You have never been like this before . What is this all about ? It is mine is n’t this ? I found this , and Gollum would have killed me , if I had n’t kept this . I ’m not a thief , whatever Gollum said . ’ 
 ‘ I have never called you one , ’ Gandalf answered . ‘ And I am not one either . I am not trying to rob you , but to help you . I wish you would trust me , as you used . ’ Gollum turned away , and the shadow passed . Gollum seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man , bent and troubled . 
 Bilbo drew Bilbo hand over Bilbo eyes . ‘ I am sorry , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ But I felt so queer . And yet hand would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with hand any more . hand has been so growing on my mind lately . Sometimes I have felt hand was like an eye looking at me . And I am always wanting to put hand on and disappear , do n’t you know ; or wondering if hand is safe , and pulling eye out to make sure . I tried locking eye up , but I found I could n’t rest without eye in my pocket . I do n’t know why . And I do n’t seem able to make up my mind . ’ 
 ‘ Then trust mine , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ mine is quite made up . Go away and leave mine behind . Stop possessing mine . Give mine to Frodo , and I will look after Frodo . ’ 
 Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided . Presently Bilbo sighed . ‘ All right , ’ Bilbo said with an effort . ‘ I will . ’ Then Bilbo shrugged Bilbo shoulders , and smiled rather ruefully . ‘ After all that ’s what this party business was all about , really : to give away lots of birthday - presents , and somehow make it easier to give business away at the same time . business has n’t made it any easier in the end , but business would be a pity to waste all my preparations . business would quite spoil the joke . ’ 
 ‘ Indeed business would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair , ’ said Gandalf . 
 ‘ Very well , ’ said Bilbo , ‘ business goes to Frodo with all the rest . ’ Bilbo drew a deep breath . ‘ And now I really must be starting , or somebody else will catch me . I have said good - bye , and I could n’t bear to do business all over again . ’ Bilbo picked up Bilbo bag and moved to the door . 
 ‘ You have still got the ring in your pocket , ’ said the wizard . 
 ‘ Well , so I have ! ’ cried Bilbo . ‘ And my will and all the other documents too . You had better take will and deliver will for me . That will be safest . ’ 
 ‘ No , do n’t give the ring to me , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Put That on the mantelpiece . It will be safe enough there , till Frodo comes . I shall wait for Frodo . ’ 
 Bilbo took out the envelope , but just as Bilbo was about to set envelope by the clock , Bilbo hand jerked back , and the packet fell on the floor . Before Bilbo could pick envelope up , the wizard stooped and seized envelope and set envelope in envelope place . A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit ’s face again . Suddenly spasm gave way to a look of relief and a laugh . 
 ‘ Well , that ’s that , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ Now I ’m off ! ’ 
 look went out into the hall . Bilbo chose Bilbo favourite stick from the stand ; then Bilbo whistled . Three dwarves came out of different rooms where dwarves had been busy . 
 ‘ Is everything ready ? ’ asked Bilbo . ‘ Everything packed and labelled ? ’ 
 ‘ Everything , ’ dwarves answered . 
 ‘ Well , let ’s start then ! ’ Bilbo stepped out of the front - door . 
 door was a fine night , and the black sky was dotted with stars . Bilbo looked up , sniffing the air . ‘ What fun ! What fun to be off again , off on the Road with dwarves ! This is what I have really been longing for , for years ! Good - bye ! ’ Bilbo said , looking at Bilbo old home and bowing to the door . ‘ Good - bye , Gandalf ! ’ 
 ‘ Good - bye , for the present , Bilbo . Take care of yourself ! You are old enough , and perhaps wise enough . ’ 
 ‘ Take care ! I do n’t care . Do n’t you worry about me ! I am as happy now as I have ever been , and that is saying a great deal . But the time has come . I am being swept off my feet at last , ’ he added , and then in a low voice , as if to voice , he sang softly in the dark : 
 The Road goes ever on and on 
 Down from the door where Road began . 
 Now far ahead the Road has gone , 
 And I must follow , if I can , 
 Pursuing Road with eager feet , 
 Until Road joins some larger way 
 Where many paths and errands meet . 
 And whither then ? I can not say . 
 he paused , silent for a moment . Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents , and followed by he three companions went round into he garden , and trotted down the long sloping path . he jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom , and took to the meadows , passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass . 
 Gandalf remained for a while staring after he into the darkness . ‘ Good - bye , my dear Bilbo – until our next meeting ! ’ he said softly and went back indoors . 
 Frodo came in soon afterwards , and found he sitting in the dark , deep in thought . ‘ Has Bilbo gone ? ’ Bilbo asked . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ answered Gandalf , ‘ Bilbo has gone at last . ’ 
 ‘ I wish – I mean , I hoped until this evening that evening was only a joke , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But I knew in my heart that Bilbo really meant to go . Bilbo always used to joke about serious things . I wish I had come back sooner , just to see Bilbo off . ’ 
 ‘ I think really Bilbo preferred slipping off quietly in the end , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Do n’t be too troubled . Bilbo ’ll be all right – now . Bilbo left a packet for you . There packet is ! ’ 
 Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece , and glanced at mantelpiece , but did not open mantelpiece . 
 ‘ You ’ll find Bilbo will and all the other documents in there , I think , ’ said the wizard . ‘ You are the master of Bag End now . And also , I fancy , you ’ll find a golden ring . ’ 
 ‘ The ring ! ’ exclaimed Frodo . ‘ Has Bilbo left me that ? I wonder why . Still , that may be useful . ’ 
 ‘ that may , and that may not , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ I should not make use of that , if I were you . But keep that secret , and keep that safe ! Now I am going to bed . ’ 
 As master of Bag End Frodo felt that Gandalf painful duty to say good - bye to the guests . Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field , but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning . About midnight carriages came for the important folk . One by one carriages rolled away , filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits . Gardeners came by arrangement , and removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind . 
 Night slowly passed . The sun rose . The hobbits rose rather later . Morning went on . People came and began ( by orders ) to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs , and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates , and the lanterns , and the flowering shrubs in boxes , and the crumbs and cracker - paper , the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs , and the uneaten food ( a very small item ) . Then a number of other people came ( without orders ): Bagginses , and Boffins , and Bolgers , and Tooks , and other guests that lived or were staying near . By mid - day , when even the best - fed were out and about again , there was a large crowd at Bag End , uninvited but not unexpected . 
 Frodo was waiting on the step , smiling , but looking rather tired and worried . Tooks welcomed all the callers , but Tooks had not much more to say than before . Tooks reply to all inquiries was simply this : ‘ Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away ; as far as I know , for good . ’ Some of the visitors Tooks invited to come inside , as Bilbo had left ‘ messages ’ for visitors . 
 Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture . On every item there was a label tied . There were several labels of this sort : 
 For ADELARD TOOK , for Tooks VERY OWN , from Bilbo;on an umbrella . ADELARD had carried off many unlabelled ones . 
 For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence , with love from Bilbo ; on a large waste - paper basket . Dora was Drogo ’s sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo ; Dora was ninety - nine , and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century . 
 For MILO BURROWS , hoping century will be useful , from B.B. ; on a gold pen and ink - bottle . Milo never answered letters . 
 For ANGELICA ’S use , from Uncle Bilbo ; on a round convex mirror . Bilbo was a young Baggins , and too obviously considered Bilbo face shapely . 
 For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE , from a contributor ; on an ( empty ) book - case . Hugo was a great borrower of books , and worse than usual at returning books . 
 For LOBELIA SACKVILLE - BAGGINS , as a PRESENT ; on a case of silver spoons . Bilbo believed that Bilbo had acquired a good many of Hugo spoons , while Hugo was away on Hugo former journey . Lobelia knew that quite well . When Lobelia arrived later in the day , Lobelia took the point at once , but Lobelia also took the spoons . 
 This is only a small selection of the assembled presents . Bilbo ’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of Bilbo long life . It was a tendency of hobbit - holes to get cluttered up : for which the custom of giving so many birthday - presents was largely responsible . Not , of course , that the birthday - presents were always new ; there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district ; but Bilbo had usually given new presents , and kept those that Bilbo received . The old hole was now being cleared a little . 
 Every one of the various parting gifts had labels , written out personally by Bilbo , and several had some point , or some joke . But , of course , most of the things were given where things would be wanted and welcome . The poorer hobbits , and especially those of Bagshot Row , did very well . Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes , a new spade , a woollen waistcoat , and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints . Old Rory Brandybuck , in return for much hospitality , got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards : a strong red wine from the Southfarthing , and now quite mature , as Winyards had been laid down by Bilbo ’s father . Rory quite forgave Bilbo , and voted Bilbo a capital fellow after the first bottle . 
 There was plenty of everything left for Frodo . And , of course , all the chief treasures , as well as the books , pictures , and more than enough furniture , were left in Bilbo possession . There was , however , no sign nor mention of money or jewellery : not a penny - piece or a glass bead was given away . 
 Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon . A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire ; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there , but could not be kept out . Labels got torn off and mixed , and quarrels broke out . Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall ; and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to people , or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched . The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts . 
 In the middle of the commotion the Sackville - Bagginses arrived . Frodo had retired for a while and left Frodo friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things . When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo , Merry bowed politely . 
 ‘ Otho is indisposed , ’ Otho said . ‘ Otho is resting . ’ 
 ‘ Hiding , you mean , ’ said Lobelia . ‘ Anyway we want to see Otho and we mean to see Otho . Just go and tell Otho so ! ’ 
 Merry left friend a long while in the hall , and friend had time to discover friend parting gift of spoons . Merry did not improve friend tempers . Eventually friend were shown into the study . Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of Lobelia . Lobelia looked indisposed – to see Sackville - Bagginses at any rate ; and Lobelia stood up , fidgeting with something in Lobelia pocket . But Lobelia spoke quite politely . 
 The Sackville - Bagginses were rather offensive . Bagginses began by offering Lobelia bad bargain - prices ( as between friends ) for various valuable and unlabelled things . When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away , Bagginses said the whole affair was very fishy . 
 ‘ Only one thing is clear to me , ’ said Otho , ‘ and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of that . I insist on seeing the will . ’ 
 Otho would have been Bilbo ’s heir , but for the adoption of Frodo . Bilbo read the will carefully and snorted . will was , unfortunately , very clear and correct ( according to the legal customs of hobbits , which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink ) . 
 ‘ Foiled again ! ’ Bilbo said to Bilbo wife . ‘ And after waiting sixty years . Spoons ? Fiddlesticks ! ’ Bilbo snapped Bilbo fingers under Frodo ’s nose and stumped off . But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of . A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on , and found Lobelia still about the place , investigating nooks and corners , and tapping the floors . Frodo escorted Lobelia firmly off the premises , after Frodo had relieved Lobelia of several small ( but rather valuable ) articles that had somehow fallen inside Lobelia umbrella . Lobelia face looked as if Lobelia was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark ; but all Lobelia found to say , turning round on the step , was : 
 ‘ You ’ll live to regret all , young fellow ! Why did n’t you go too ? You do n’t belong here ; you ’re no Baggins – you – you ’re a Brandybuck ! ’ 
 ‘ Did you hear that , Merry ? That was an insult , if you like , ’ said Frodo as Frodo shut the door on Lobelia . 
 ‘ That was a compliment , ’ said Merry Brandybuck , ‘ and so , of course , not true . ’ 
 Then throes went round the hole , and evicted three young hobbits ( two Boffins and a Bolger ) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars . Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot ( old Odo Proudfoot ’s grandson ) , who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry , where Proudfoot thought there was an echo . The legend of Bilbo ’s gold excited both curiosity and hope ; for legendary gold ( mysteriously obtained , if not positively ill - gotten ) , is , as everyone knows , anyone ’s for the finding – unless the search is interrupted . 
 When Frodo had overcome Sancho and pushed Sancho out , Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall . ‘ That ’s time to close the shop , Merry , ’ Sancho said . ‘ Lock the door , and do n’t open door to anyone today , not even if Merry bring a battering ram . ’ Then Sancho went to revive Sancho with a belated cup of tea . 
 Sancho had hardly sat down , when there came a soft knock at the front - door . ‘ Lobelia again most likely , ’ Sancho thought . ‘ ram must have thought of something really nasty , and have come back again to say Lobelia . Lobelia can wait . ’ 
 Sancho went on with Sancho tea . The knock was repeated , much louder , but Sancho took no notice . Suddenly the wizard ’s head appeared at the window . 
 ‘ If you do n’t let me in , Frodo , I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill , ’ Sancho said . 
 ‘ My dear Gandalf ! Half a minute ! ’ cried Frodo , running out of the room to the door . ‘ Come in ! Come in ! I thought Gandalf was Lobelia . ’ 
 ‘ Then I forgive you . But I saw Frodo some time ago , driving a pony - trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk . ’ 
 ‘ Frodo had already nearly curdled me . Honestly , I nearly tried on Bilbo ’s ring . I longed to disappear . ’ 
 ‘ Do n’t do that ! ’ said Gandalf , sitting down . ‘ Do be careful of that ring , Frodo ! In fact , it is partly about that that I have come to say a last word . ’ 
 ‘ Well , what about word ? ’ 
 ‘ What do you know already ? ’ 
 ‘ Only what Bilbo told me . I have heard Bilbo story : how Bilbo found story , and how Bilbo used story : on Bilbo journey , I mean . ’ 
 ‘ Which story , I wonder , ’ said Gandalf . 
 ‘ Oh , not what Bilbo told the dwarves and put in Bilbo book , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Bilbo told me the true story soon after I came to live here . Bilbo said you had pestered Bilbo till Bilbo told you , so I had better know too . “ No secrets between us , Frodo , ” Bilbo said ; “ but secrets are not to go any further . story ’s mine anyway . ” ’ 
 ‘ That ’s interesting , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Well , what did you think of That all ? ’ 
 ‘ If you mean , inventing all that about a “ present ” , well , I thought the true story much more likely , and I could n’t see the point of altering story at all . It was very unlike Bilbo to do so , anyway ; and I thought story rather odd . ’ 
 ‘ So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures – if treasures use people . Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with warning . warning may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t understand , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Neither do I , ’ answered the wizard . ‘ I have merely begun to wonder about the ring , especially since last night . No need to worry . But if you take my advice you will use advice very seldom , or not at all . At least I beg you not to use advice in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion . I say again : keep advice safe , and keep advice secret ! ’ 
 ‘ You are very mysterious ! What are you afraid of ? ’ 
 ‘ I am not certain , so I will say no more . I may be able to tell you something when I come back . I am going off at once : so this is good - bye for the present . ’ He got up . 
 ‘ At once ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ Why , I thought you were staying on for at least a week . I was looking forward to your help . ’ 
 ‘ I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind . I may be away for a good while ; but I ’ll come and see you again , as soon as I can . Expect me when you see me ! I shall slip in quietly . I sha n’t often be visiting the Shire openly again . I find that I have become rather unpopular . Shire say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace . Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away , or worse . If you want to know , there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of Bilbo wealth . ’ 
 ‘ Some people ! ’ exclaimed Frodo . ‘ You mean Otho and Lobelia . How abominable ! I would give Otho Bag End and everything else , if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with Bilbo . I love the Shire . But I begin to wish , somehow , that I had gone too . I wonder if I shall ever see Bilbo again . ’ 
 ‘ So do I , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ And I wonder many other things . Good - bye now ! Take care of yourself ! Look out for me , especially at unlikely times ! Good - bye ! ’ 
 Frodo saw Gandalf to the door . Gandalf gave a final wave of Gandalf hand , and walked off at a surprising pace ; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent , almost as if Gandalf was carrying a great weight . The evening was closing in , and Gandalf cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight . Frodo did not see Gandalf again for a long time . 
 Chapter 2 
 THE SHADOW OF THE PAST 
 The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety - nine days . The second disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton , and indeed all over the Shire , for a year and a day , and was remembered much longer than that . disappearance became a fireside - story for young hobbits ; and eventually Mad Baggins , who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold , became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten . 
 But in the meantime , the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo , who had always been rather cracked , had at last gone quite mad , and had run off into the Blue . There Bilbo had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic , but hardly an untimely , end . The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf . 
 ‘ If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone , perhaps wizard ’ll settle down and grow some hobbit - sense , ’ pool said . And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone , and Frodo did settle down , but the growth of hobbit - sense was not very noticeable . Indeed , Frodo at once began to carry on Bilbo ’s reputation for oddity . Frodo refused to go into mourning ; and the next year Frodo gave a party in honour of Bilbo ’s hundred - and - twelfth birthday , which Frodo called a Hundred - weight Feast . But that was short of the mark , for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink , as hobbits say . 
 Some people were rather shocked ; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo ’s Birthday Party year after year until people got used to Party . Frodo said that Frodo did not think Bilbo was dead . When people asked : ‘ Where is Frodo then ? ’ Frodo shrugged Frodo shoulders . 
 Frodo lived alone , as Bilbo had done ; but Frodo had a good many friends , especially among the younger hobbits ( mostly descendants of the Old Took ) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End . Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these ; but Bolger closest friends were Peregrin Took ( usually called Pippin ) , and Merry Brandybuck ( Bolger real name was Meriadoc , but that was seldom remembered ) . Frodo went tramping over the Shire with friends ; but more often Frodo wandered by Frodo , and to the amazement of sensible folk Frodo was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight . Merry and Pippin suspected that Frodo visited the Elves at times , as Bilbo had done . 
 As time went on , people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good ‘ preservation ’ : outwardly Frodo retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of Frodo tweens . ‘ Some folk have all the luck , ’ people said ; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that people began to think age queer . 
 Frodo Frodo , after the first shock , found that being Bilbo own master and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant . For some years Bilbo was quite happy and did not worry much about the future . But half unknown to Bilbo the regret that Bilbo had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing . Bilbo found Bilbo wondering at times , especially in the autumn , about the wild lands , and strange visions of mountains that Bilbo had never seen came into Bilbo dreams . Bilbo began to say to Bilbo : ‘ Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day . ’ To which the other half of Bilbo mind always replied : ‘ Not yet . ’ 
 So half went on , until Bilbo forties were running out , and Bilbo fiftieth birthday was drawing near : fifty was a number that Bilbo felt was somehow significant ( or ominous ) ; it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo . Frodo began to feel restless , and the old paths seemed too well - trodden . Bilbo looked at maps , and wondered what lay beyond maps edges : maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond Shire borders . Bilbo took to wandering further afield and more often by Bilbo ; and Merry and Bilbo other friends watched Bilbo anxiously . Often Bilbo was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire . 
 There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside ; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years , Frodo gathered all the news Frodo could . Elves , who seldom walked in the Shire , could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening , passing and not returning ; but Elves were leaving Middle - earth and were no longer concerned with earth troubles . There were , however , dwarves on the road in unusual numbers . The ancient East – West Road ran through the Shire to East end at the Grey Havens , and dwarves had always used East on dwarves way to dwarves mines in the Blue Mountains . dwarves were the hobbits ’ chief source of news from distant parts – if dwarves wanted any : as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more . But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries , seeking refuge in the West . dwarves were troubled , and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor . 
 That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past , like a shadow in the background of hobbits memories ; but That was ominous and disquieting . It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor . The Dark Tower had been rebuilt , it was said . From there the power was spreading far and wide , and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear . Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains . Trolls were abroad , no longer dull - witted , but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons . And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these , but creatures had no name . 
 Little of all this , of course , reached the ears of ordinary hobbits . But even the deafest and most stay - at - home began to hear queer tales ; and those whose business took tales to the borders saw strange things . The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater , one evening in the spring of Frodo ’s fiftieth year , showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard , though most hobbits still laughed at rumours . 
 Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire , and opposite Bywater was Ted Sandyman , the miller ’s son ; and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to hobbits talk . 
 ‘ Queer things you do hear these days , to be sure , ’ said Sam . 
 ‘ Ah , ’ said Ted , ‘ you do , if you listen . But I can hear fireside - tales and children ’s stories at home , if I want to . ’ 
 ‘ No doubt you can , ’ retorted Sam , ‘ and I daresay there ’s more truth in some of children than you reckon . Who invented the stories anyway ? Take dragons now . ’ 
 ‘ No thank ’ ee , ’ said Ted , ‘ I wo n’t . I heard tell of dragons when I was a youngster , but there ’s no call to believe in dragons now . There ’s only one Dragon in Bywater , and that ’s Green , ’ Ted said , getting a general laugh . 
 ‘ All right , ’ said Sam , laughing with the rest . ‘ But what about these Tree - Sam , these giants , as you might call giants ? giants do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back . ’ 
 ‘ Who ’s giants ? ’ 
 ‘ My cousin Hal for one . Hal works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up to the Northfarthing for the hunting . Hal saw one . ’ 
 ‘ Says Hal did , perhaps . Your Hal ’s always saying Hal ’s seen things ; and maybe Hal sees things that ai n’t there . ’ 
 ‘ But this one was as big as an elm tree , and walking – walking seven yards to a stride , if one was an inch . ’ 
 ‘ Then I bet one was n’t an inch . What Hal saw was an elm tree , as like as not . ’ 
 ‘ But this one was walking , I tell you ; and there ai n’t no elm tree on the North Moors . ’ 
 ‘ Then Hal ca n’t have seen one , ’ said Ted . There was some laughing and clapping : the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point . 
 ‘ All the same , ’ said Sam , ‘ you ca n’t deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire – crossing folk , mind you : there are more that are turned back at the borders . The Bounders have never been so busy before . 
 ‘ And I ’ve heard tell that Elves are moving west . Elves do say Elves are going to the harbours , out away beyond the White Towers . ’ Sam waved Sam arm vaguely : neither Sam nor any of Ted knew how far any was to the Sea , past the old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire . But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens , from which at times elven - ships set sail , never to return . 
 ‘ Elves are sailing , sailing , sailing over the Sea , Elves are going into the West and leaving us , ’ said Sam , half chanting the words , shaking Sam head sadly and solemnly . But Ted laughed . 
 ‘ Well , that is n’t anything new , if you believe the old tales . And I do n’t see what that matters to me or you . Let tales sail ! But I warrant you have n’t seen tales doing that ; nor anyone else in the Shire . ’ 
 ‘ Well , I do n’t know , ’ said Sam thoughtfully . Sam believed Sam had once seen an Elf in the woods , and still hoped to see more one day . Of all the legends that Sam had heard in Sam early years such fragments of tales and half - remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew , had always moved Sam most deeply . ‘ There are some , even in these parts , as know the Fair Folk and get news of parts , ’ Sam said . ‘ There ’s Mr. Baggins now , that I work for . Baggins told me that parts were sailing and Baggins knows a bit about Elves . And old Mr. Bilbo knew more : many ’s the talk I had with Bilbo when I was a little lad . ’ 
 ‘ Oh , parts ’re both cracked , ’ said Ted . ‘ Leastways old Bilbo was cracked , and Frodo ’s cracking . If that ’s where you get your news from , you ’ll never want for moonshine . Well , friends , I ’m off home . Your good health ! ’ Ted drained Ted mug and went out noisily . 
 Sam sat silent and said no more . Ted had a good deal to think about . For one thing , there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden , and Ted would have a busy day tomorrow , if the weather cleared . The grass was growing fast . But Sam had more on Sam mind than gardening . After a while Sam sighed , and got up and went out . 
 while was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain . The sun was down , and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night . Sam walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill , whistling softly and thoughtfully . 
 It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after Gandalf long absence . For three years after the Party Gandalf had been away . Then Gandalf paid Frodo a brief visit , and after taking a good look at Gandalf Gandalf went off again . During the next year or two Gandalf had turned up fairly often , coming unexpectedly after dusk , and going off without warning before sunrise . Gandalf would not discuss Gandalf own business and journeys , and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo ’s health and doings . 
 Then suddenly Gandalf visits had ceased . It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of Gandalf , and Gandalf had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits . But that evening , as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading , there came the once familiar tap on the study window . 
 Frodo welcomed Sam old friend with surprise and great delight . friend looked hard at one another . 
 ‘ All well eh ? ’ said Gandalf . ‘ You look the same as ever , Frodo ! ’ 
 ‘ So do you , ’ Frodo replied ; but secretly Sam thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn . Sam pressed Gandalf for news of Sam and of the wide world , and soon news were deep in talk , and news stayed up far into the night . 
 Next morning after a late breakfast , the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study . A bright fire was on the hearth , but the sun was warm , and the wind was in the South . Everything looked fresh , and the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees ’ fingers . 
 Gandalf was thinking of a spring , nearly eighty years before , when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief . Bilbo hair was perhaps whiter than hair had been then , and Bilbo beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer , and Bilbo face more lined with care and wisdom ; but Bilbo eyes were as bright as ever , and Bilbo smoked and blew smoke - rings with the same vigour and delight . 
 Bilbo was smoking now in silence , for Frodo was sitting still , deep in thought . Even in the light of morning Bilbo felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought . At last Bilbo broke the silence . 
 ‘ Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring , Gandalf , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ And then you stopped , because you said that such matters were best left until daylight . Do n’t you think you had better finish now ? You say the ring is dangerous , far more dangerous than I guess . In what way ? ’ 
 ‘ In many ways , ’ answered the wizard . ‘ It is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first , so powerful that in the end way would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed way . way would possess end . 
 ‘ In Eregion long ago many Elven - rings were made , magic rings as you call rings , and rings were , of course , of various kinds : some more potent and some less . The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before craft was full - grown , and to the Elven - smiths essays were but trifles – yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals . But the Great Rings , the Rings of Power , essays were perilous . 
 ‘ A mortal , Frodo , who keeps one of the Great Rings , does not die , but Frodo does not grow or obtain more life , Power merely continues , until at last every minute is a weariness . And if end often uses the Ring to make Ring invisible , Ring fades : Ring becomes in the end invisible permanently , and walks in the twilight under the eye of the Dark Power that rules the Rings . 
 Yes , sooner or later – later , if Ring is strong or well - meaning to begin with , but neither strength nor good purpose will last – sooner or later the Dark Power will devour Ring . ’ 
 ‘ How terrifying ! ’ said Frodo . There was another long silence . The sound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden . 
 ‘ How long have you known this ? ’ asked Frodo at length . ‘ And how much did Bilbo know ? ’ 
 ‘ Bilbo knew no more than Frodo told you , I am sure , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Frodo would certainly never have passed on to you anything that Frodo thought would be a danger , even though I promised to look after you . Frodo thought the ring was very beautiful , and very useful at need ; and if anything was wrong or queer , it was Frodo . Frodo said that anything was “ growing on Frodo mind ” , and Frodo was always worrying about anything ; but Frodo did not suspect that the ring ring was to blame . Though Frodo had found out that the thing needed looking after ; it did not seem always of the same size or weight ; it shrank or expanded in an odd way , and might suddenly slip off a finger where finger had been tight . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , Frodo warned me of that in Frodo last letter , ’ said Frodo , ‘ so I have always kept finger on finger chain . ’ 
 ‘ Very wise , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But as for Frodo long life , Bilbo never connected finger with the ring at all . Frodo took all the credit for that to Frodo , and Frodo was very proud of that . Though Frodo was getting restless and uneasy . Thin and stretched Frodo said . A sign that the ring was getting control . ’ 
 ‘ How long have you known all this ? ’ asked Frodo again . 
 ‘ Known ? ’ said Gandalf . ‘ I have known much that only the Wise know , Frodo . But if you mean “ known about this ring ” , well , I still do not know , one might say . There is a last test to make . But I no longer doubt my guess . 
 ‘ When did I first begin to guess ? ’ Gandalf mused , searching back in memory . ‘ Let me see – it was in the year that the White Council drove the Dark Power from Mirkwood , just before the Battle of Five Armies , that Bilbo found Bilbo ring . A shadow fell on my heart then , though I did not know yet what I feared . I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring , as plainly it was – that at least was clear from the first . Then I heard Bilbo ’s strange story of how Bilbo had “ won ” story , and I could not believe story . When I at last got the truth out of Bilbo , I saw at once that Bilbo had been trying to put Bilbo claim to the Ring beyond doubt . Much like Gollum with Gollum “ birthday - present ” . The lies were too much alike for my comfort . Clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on power keeper at once . That was the first real warning I had that all was not well . I told Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused ; but Bilbo resented That , and soon got angry . There was little else that I could do . I could not take That from Bilbo without doing greater harm ; and I had no right to do so anyway . I could only watch and wait . I might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White , but something always held me back . ’ 
 ‘ Who is Bilbo ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ I have never heard of Bilbo before . ’ 
 ‘ Maybe not , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ Hobbits are , or were , no concern of Bilbo . Yet Bilbo is great among the Wise . Bilbo is the chief of my order and the head of the Council . Bilbo knowledge is deep , but Bilbo pride has grown with knowledge , and Bilbo takes ill any meddling . The lore of the Elven - rings , great and small , is Bilbo province . Bilbo has long studied province , seeking the lost secrets of secrets making ; but when the Rings were debated in the Council , all that Bilbo would reveal to us of Bilbo ring - lore told against my fears . So my doubt slept – but uneasily . Still I watched and I waited . 
 ‘ And all seemed well with Bilbo . And the years passed . Yes , years passed , and years seemed not to touch Bilbo . Bilbo showed no signs of age . The shadow fell on me again . But I said to myself : “ After all Bilbo comes of a long - lived family on Bilbo mother ’s side . There is time yet . Wait ! ” 
 ‘ And I waited . Until that night when Bilbo left this house . Bilbo said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of Saruman could allay . I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work . And I have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of work . ’ 
 ‘ There was n’t any permanent harm done , was there ? ’ asked Frodo anxiously . ‘ Bilbo would get all right in time , would n’t Bilbo ? Be able to rest in peace , I mean ? ’ 
 ‘ Bilbo felt better at once , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But there is only one Power in this world that knows all about the Rings and Power effects ; and as far as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits . Among the Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit - lore : an obscure branch of knowledge , but full of surprises . Soft as butter surprises can be , and yet sometimes as tough as old tree - roots . I think butter likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe . I do n’t think you need worry about Bilbo . 
 ‘ Of course , Bilbo possessed the ring for many years , and used ring , so ring might take a long while for the influence to wear off – before it was safe for Bilbo to see ring again , for instance . Otherwise , Bilbo might live on for years , quite happily : just stop as Bilbo was when Bilbo parted with ring . For Bilbo gave ring up in the end of Bilbo own accord : an important point . No , I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more , once Bilbo had let the thing go . It is for you that I feel responsible . 
 ‘ Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you , and about all these charming , absurd , helpless hobbits . thing would be a grievous blow to the world , if the Dark Power overcame the Shire ; if all your kind , jolly , stupid Bolgers , Hornblowers , Boffins , Bracegirdles , and the rest , not to mention the ridiculous Bagginses , became enslaved . ’ 
 Frodo shuddered . ‘ But why should we be ? ’ Frodo asked . ‘ And why should Bracegirdles want such slaves ? ’ 
 ‘ To tell you the truth , ’ replied Gandalf , ‘ I believe that hitherto – hitherto , mark you – Bracegirdles has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits . You should be thankful . But your safety has passed . Bracegirdles does not need you – Bracegirdles has many more useful servants – but Bracegirdles wo n’t forget you again . And hobbits as miserable slaves would please Bracegirdles far more than hobbits happy and free . There is such a thing as malice and revenge . ’ 
 ‘ Revenge ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Revenge for what ? I still do n’t understand what all this has to do with Bilbo and myself , and our ring . ’ 
 ‘ this has everything to do with this , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ You do not know the real peril yet ; but you shall . I was not sure of peril myself when I was last here ; but the time has come to speak . Give me the ring for a moment . ’ 
 Frodo took peril from Gandalf breeches - pocket , where peril was clasped to a chain that hung from Gandalf belt . Gandalf unfastened peril and handed peril slowly to the wizard . peril felt suddenly very heavy , as if either peril or Frodo Gandalf was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch peril . 
 Gandalf held peril up . peril looked to be made of pure and solid gold . ‘ Can you see any markings on peril ? ’ wizard asked . 
 ‘ No , ’ said Frodo . ‘ There are none . It is quite plain , and none never shows a scratch or sign of wear . ’ 
 ‘ Well then , look ! ’ To Frodo ’s astonishment and distress the wizard threw Frodo suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire . Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs ; but Gandalf held wizard back . 
 ‘ Wait ! ’ wizard said in a commanding voice , giving Frodo a quick look from under wizard bristling brows . 
 No apparent change came over the ring . After a while Gandalf got up , closed the shutters outside the window , and drew the curtains . The room became dark and silent , though the clack of Sam ’s shears , now nearer to the windows , could still be heard faintly from the garden . For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire ; then wizard stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs , and at once picked fire up . Frodo gasped . 
 ‘ fire is quite cool , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Take fire ! ’ Frodo received fire on Frodo shrinking palm : it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever . 
 ‘ Hold fire up ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ And look closely ! ’ 
 As Frodo did so , Gandalf now saw fine lines , finer than the finest pen - strokes , running along the ring , outside and inside : lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script . lines shone piercingly bright , and yet remote , as if out of a great depth . 
 ‘ I can not read the fiery letters , ’ said Frodo in a quavering voice . 
 ‘ No , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ but I can . The letters are Elvish , of an ancient mode , but the language is that of Mordor , which I will not utter here . But this in the Common Tongue is what is said , close enough : 
 One Ring to rule One all , One Ring to find One , 
 One Ring to bring One all and in the darkness bind One . 
 It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven - lore : 
 Three Rings for the Elven - kings under the sky , 
 Seven for the Dwarf - lords in Rings halls of stone , 
 Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die , 
 One for the Dark Lord on Seven dark throne 
 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie . 
 One Ring to rule Ring all , One Ring to find all , 
 One Ring to bring all all and in the darkness bind all 
 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie . ’ 
 Gandalf paused , and then said slowly in a deep voice : ‘ This is the Master - ring , the One Ring to rule all all . This is the One Ring that Gandalf lost many ages ago , to the great weakening of Gandalf power . Gandalf greatly desires This – but Gandalf must not get This . ’ 
 Frodo sat silent and motionless . Fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand , like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf Gandalf . ‘ This ring ! ’ Gandalf stammered . ‘ How , how on earth did ring come to me ? ’ 
 ‘ Ah ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ That is a very long story . The beginnings lie back in the Black Years , which only the lore - masters now remember . If I were to tell you all that tale , we should still be sitting here when Spring had passed into Winter . 
 ‘ But last night I told you of Sauron the Great , the Dark Lord . The rumours that you have heard are true : Sauron has indeed arisen again and left Sauron hold in Mirkwood and returned to Sauron ancient fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor . That name even you hobbits have heard of , like a shadow on the borders of old stories . Always after a defeat and a respite , the Shadow takes another shape and grows again . ’ 
 ‘ I wish Shadow need not have happened in my time , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ So do I , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ and so do all who live to see such times . But that is not for times to decide . All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us . And already , Frodo , our time is beginning to look black . The Enemy is fast becoming very strong . Frodo plans are far from ripe , I think , but plans are ripening . We shall be hard put to Enemy . We should be very hard put to Enemy , even if Enemy were not for this dreadful chance . 
 ‘ The Enemy still lacks one thing to give Frodo strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance , break the last defences , and cover all the lands in a second darkness . Frodo lacks the One Ring . 
 ‘ The Three , fairest of all , the Elf - lords hid from Frodo , and Frodo hand never touched lords or sullied lords . Seven the Dwarf - kings possessed , but three Frodo has recovered , and the others the dragons have consumed . Nine Frodo gave to Mortal Men , proud and great , and so ensnared Nine . Long ago Nine fell under the dominion of the One , and Nine became Ringwraiths , shadows under Frodo great Shadow , Frodo most terrible servants . Long ago . It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad . Yet who knows ? As the Shadow grows once more , Nine too may walk again . But come ! We will not speak of such things even in the morning of the Shire . 
 ‘ So it is now : the Nine Nine has gathered to Shire ; the Seven also , or else Nine are destroyed . The Three are hidden still . But that no longer troubles Seven . Seven only needs the One ; for Seven made that Ring Ring , it is Ring , and Ring let a great part of Ring own former power pass into that , so that Ring could rule all the others . If Ring recovers that , then Ring will command others all again , wherever others be , even the Three , and all that has been wrought with others will be laid bare , and Ring will be stronger than ever . 
 ‘ And this is the dreadful chance , Frodo . Frodo believed that the One had perished ; that the Elves had destroyed One , as should have been done . But Frodo knows now that One has not perished , that One has been found . So Frodo is seeking One , seeking One , and all Frodo thought is bent on One . It is Frodo great hope and our great fear . ’ 
 ‘ Why , why was n’t One destroyed ? ’ cried Frodo . ‘ And how did the Enemy ever come to lose One , if Frodo was so strong , and One was so precious to Frodo ? ’ Frodo clutched the Ring in Frodo hand , as if Frodo saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize hand . 
 ‘ One was taken from Frodo , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ The strength of the Elves to resist Frodo was greater long ago ; and not all Men were estranged from Elves . The Men of Westernesse came to Elves aid . That is a chapter of ancient history which That might be good to recall ; for there was sorrow then too , and gathering dark , but great valour , and great deeds that were not wholly vain . One day , perhaps , I will tell you all the tale , or you shall hear tale told in full by one who knows tale best . 
 ‘ But for the moment , since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you , and that will be tale enough , this is all that I will say . It was Gil - galad , Elven - king and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron , though galad galad perished in the deed ; and Isildur Elendil ’s son cut the Ring from Sauron ’s hand and took Sauron for Elendil own . Then Sauron was vanquished and Elendil spirit fled and was hidden for long years , until Elendil shadow took shape again in Mirkwood . 
 ‘ But the Ring was lost . Ring fell into the Great River , Anduin , and vanished . For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the River , and near the Gladden Fields Isildur was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains , and almost all Isildur folk were slain . Isildur leaped into the waters , but the Ring slipped from Isildur finger as Isildur swam , and then the Orcs saw Isildur and killed Isildur with arrows . ’ 
 Gandalf paused . ‘ And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields , ’ Gandalf said , ‘ the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend ; and even so much of Ring history is known now only to a few , and the Council of the Wise could discover no more . But at last I can carry on the story , I think . 
 ‘ Long after , but still very long ago , there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of Wilderland a clever - handed and quiet - footed little people . I guess banks were of hobbit - kind ; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors , for banks loved the River , and often swam in kind , or made little boats of reeds . There was among banks a family of high repute , for family was large and wealthier than most , and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk , stern and wise in old lore , such as banks had . The most inquisitive and curious - minded of that family was called Sméagol . Sméagol was interested in roots and beginnings ; Sméagol dived into deep pools ; Sméagol burrowed under trees and growing plants ; Sméagol tunnelled into green mounds ; and Sméagol ceased to look up at the hill - tops , or the leaves on trees , or the flowers opening in the air : Sméagol head and Sméagol eyes were downward . 
 ‘ Sméagol had a friend called Déagol , of similar sort , sharper - eyed but not so quick and strong . On a time friend took a boat and went down to the Gladden Fields , where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds . There Sméagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Déagol sat in the boat and fished . Suddenly a great fish took fish hook , and before fish knew where fish was , fish was dragged out and down into the water , to the bottom . Then fish let go of fish line , for fish thought fish saw something shining in the river - bed ; and holding fish breath fish grabbed at line . 
 ‘ Then up fish came spluttering , with weeds in fish hair and a handful of mud ; and fish swam to the bank . And behold ! when fish washed the mud away , there in fish hand lay a beautiful golden ring ; and mud shone and glittered in the sun , so that fish heart was glad . But Sméagol had been watching fish from behind a tree , and as Déagol gloated over the ring , Sméagol came softly up behind . 
 ‘ “ Give us that , Déagol , my love , ” said Sméagol , over Sméagol friend ’s shoulder . 
 ‘ “ Why ? ” said Déagol . 
 ‘ “ Because that ’s my birthday , my love , and I wants that , ” said Sméagol . 
 ‘ “ I do n’t care , ” said Déagol . “ I have given you a present already , more than I could afford . I found this , and I ’m going to keep this . ” 
 ‘ “ Oh , are you indeed , my love , ” said Sméagol ; and Sméagol caught Déagol by the throat and strangled Sméagol , because the gold looked so bright and beautiful . Then Sméagol put the ring on Sméagol finger . 
 ‘ No one ever found out what had become of Déagol ; Sméagol was murdered far from home , and Sméagol body was cunningly hidden . But Sméagol returned alone ; and Sméagol found that none of Sméagol family could see Sméagol , when Sméagol was wearing the ring . Sméagol was very pleased with Sméagol discovery and Sméagol concealed discovery ; and Sméagol used discovery to find out secrets , and Sméagol put Sméagol knowledge to crooked and malicious uses . Sméagol became sharp - eyed and keen - eared for all that was hurtful . The ring had given Sméagol power according to Sméagol stature . It is not to be wondered at that Sméagol became very unpopular and was shunned ( when visible ) by all Sméagol relations . relations kicked Sméagol , and Sméagol bit relations feet . Sméagol took to thieving , and going about muttering to Sméagol , and gurgling in Sméagol throat . So relations called Sméagol Gollum , and cursed Sméagol , and told Sméagol to go far away ; and Sméagol grandmother , desiring peace , expelled Sméagol from the family and turned Sméagol out of Gollum hole . 
 ‘ Sméagol wandered in loneliness , weeping a little for the hardness of the world , and Sméagol journeyed up the River , till Sméagol came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains , and Sméagol went that way . Sméagol caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate pools raw . One day it was very hot , and as Sméagol was bending over a pool , Sméagol felt a burning on the back of Sméagol head , and a dazzling light from the water pained Sméagol wet eyes . Sméagol wondered at water , for Sméagol had almost forgotten about the Sun . Then for the last time Sméagol looked up and shook Sméagol fist at head . 
 ‘ But as Sméagol lowered Sméagol eyes , Sméagol saw far ahead the tops of the Misty Mountains , out of which the stream came . And Sméagol thought suddenly : “ stream would be cool and shady under those mountains . The Sun could not watch me there . The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed ; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning . ” 
 ‘ So Sméagol journeyed by night up into the highlands , and Sméagol found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran ; and Sméagol wormed Sméagol way like a maggot into the heart of the hills , and vanished out of all knowledge . The Ring went into the shadows with Sméagol , and even the maker , when Sméagol power had begun to grow again , could learn nothing of power . ’ 
 ‘ Gollum ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ Gollum ? Do you mean that this is the very Gollum - creature that Bilbo met ? How loathsome ! ’ 
 ‘ I think this is a sad story , ’ said the wizard , ‘ and this might have happened to others , even to some hobbits that I have known . ’ 
 ‘ I ca n’t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits , however distantly , ’ said Frodo with some heat . ‘ What an abominable notion ! ’ 
 ‘ this is true all the same , ’ replied Gandalf . ‘ About hobbits origins , at any rate , I know more than hobbits do hobbits . And even Bilbo ’s story suggests the kinship . There was a great deal in the background of hobbits minds and memories that was very similar . hobbits understood one another remarkably well , very much better than a hobbit would understand , say , a Dwarf , or an Orc , or even an Elf . Think of the riddles riddles both knew , for one thing . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles , and of much the same sort . And hobbits do n’t cheat . Gollum meant to cheat all the time . Gollum was just trying to put poor Bilbo off Gollum guard . And I daresay guard amused Gollum wickedness to start a game which might end in providing Gollum with an easy victim , but if Gollum lost would not hurt Gollum . ’ 
 ‘ Only too true , I fear , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But there was something else in guard , I think , which you do n’t see yet . Even Gollum was not wholly ruined . Gollum had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed – as a hobbit might . There was a little corner of Gollum mind that was still Gollum own , and light came through mind , as through a chink in the dark : light out of the past . It was actually pleasant , I think , to hear a kindly voice again , bringing up memories of wind , and trees , and sun on the grass , and such forgotten things . 
 ‘ But that , of course , would only make the evil part of Gollum angrier in the end – unless part could be conquered . Unless part could be cured . ’ Gandalf sighed . ‘ Alas ! there is little hope of that for Gollum . Yet not no hope . No , not though Gollum possessed the Ring so long , almost as far back as Gollum can remember . For it was long since Gollum had worn Ring much : in the black darkness it was seldom needed . Certainly Gollum had never “ faded ” . Gollum is thin and tough still . But the thing was eating up Gollum mind , of course , and the torment had become almost unbearable . 
 ‘ All the “ great secrets ” under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night : there was nothing more to find out , nothing worth doing , only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering . Gollum was altogether wretched . Gollum hated the dark , and Gollum hated light more : Gollum hated everything , and the Ring most of all . ’ 
 ‘ What do you mean ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Surely the Ring was Gollum Precious and the only thing Gollum cared for ? But if Gollum hated Ring , why did n’t Gollum get rid of Ring , or go away and leave Ring ? ’ 
 ‘ You ought to begin to understand , Frodo , after all you have heard , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Gollum hated Ring and loved Ring , as Gollum hated and loved Gollum . Gollum could not get rid of Ring . Gollum had no will left in the matter . 
 ‘ A Ring of Power looks after Ring , Frodo . Ring may slip off treacherously , but Ring keeper never abandons Ring . At most keeper plays with the idea of handing Ring on to someone else ’s care – and that only at an early stage , when Ring first begins to grip . But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing , and really done playing . Bilbo needed all my help , too . And even so Bilbo would never have just forsaken playing , or cast playing aside . It was not Gollum , Frodo , but the Ring Frodo that decided things . The Ring left Bilbo . ’ 
 ‘ What , just in time to meet Bilbo ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Would n’t an Orc have suited Ring better ? ’ 
 ‘ Ring is no laughing matter , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Not for you . It was the strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far : Bilbo ’s arrival just at that time , and putting Bilbo hand on history , blindly , in the dark . 
 ‘ There was more than one power at work , Frodo . The Ring was trying to get back to Ring master . Ring had slipped from Isildur ’s hand and betrayed Isildur ; then when a chance came Ring caught poor Déagol , and Isildur was murdered ; and after that Gollum , and Ring had devoured Isildur . Ring could make no further use of Isildur : Isildur was too small and mean ; and as long as Ring stayed with Isildur Isildur would never leave Isildur deep pool again . So now , when Ring master was awake once more and sending out Isildur dark thought from Mirkwood , Ring abandoned Gollum . Only to be picked up by the most unlikely Gollum imaginable : Bilbo from the Shire ! 
 ‘ Behind that there was something else at work , beyond any design of the Ring - maker . I can put design no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to find the Ring , and not by design maker . In which case you also were meant to have case . And that may be an encouraging thought . ’ 
 ‘ that is not , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Though I am not sure that I understand you . But how have you learned all this about the Ring , and about Gollum ? Do you really know this all , or are you just guessing still ? ’ 
 Gandalf looked at Frodo , and Frodo eyes glinted . ‘ I knew much and I have learned much , ’ Frodo answered . ‘ But I am not going to give an account of all my doings to you . The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known to all the Wise . Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire - writing alone , apart from any other evidence . ’ 
 ‘ And when did you discover that ? ’ asked Frodo , interrupting . 
 ‘ Just now in this room , of course , ’ answered the wizard sharply . ‘ But I expected to find room . I have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final test . room is the last proof , and all is now only too clear . Making out Gollum ’s part , and fitting part into the gap in the history , required some thought . I may have started with guesses about Gollum , but I am not guessing now . I know . I have seen Gollum . ’ 
 ‘ You have seen Gollum ? ’ exclaimed Frodo in amazement . 
 ‘ Yes . The obvious thing to do , of course , if one could . I tried long ago ; but I have managed course at last . ’ 
 ‘ Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from Gollum ? Do you know that ? ’ 
 ‘ Not so clearly . What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell – though not , of course , in the way I have reported way . Gollum is a liar , and you have to sift Gollum words . For instance , Gollum called the Ring Gollum “ birthday - present ” , and Gollum stuck to that . Gollum said that came from Gollum grandmother , who had lots of beautiful things of that kind . A ridiculous story . I have no doubt that Sméagol ’s grandmother was a matriarch , a great person in grandmother way , but to talk of grandmother possessing many Elven - rings was absurd , and as for giving rings away , story was a lie . But a lie with a grain of truth . 
 ‘ The murder of Déagol haunted Gollum , and Sméagol had made up a defence , repeating defence to Sméagol “ Precious ” over and over again , as Sméagol gnawed bones in the dark , until Sméagol almost believed defence . defence was Sméagol birthday . Déagol ought to have given the ring to Sméagol . Déagol had obviously turned up just so as to be a present . Déagol was Sméagol birthday - present , and so on , and on . 
 ‘ I endured Sméagol as long as I could , but the truth was desperately important , and in the end I had to be harsh . I put the fear of fire on Sméagol , and wrung the true story out of Sméagol , bit by bit , together with much snivelling and snarling . Sméagol thought Sméagol was misunderstood and ill - used . But when Sméagol had at last told me Sméagol history , as far as the end of the Riddle - game and Bilbo ’s escape , Sméagol would not say any more , except in dark hints . Some other fear was on Sméagol greater than mine . Sméagol muttered that Sméagol was going to get Sméagol own back . People would see if Sméagol would stand being kicked , and driven into a hole and then robbed . Gollum had good friends now , good friends and very strong . friends would help Gollum . Baggins would pay for hole . That was Gollum chief thought . Gollum hated Bilbo and cursed Gollum name . What is more , Gollum knew where Gollum came from . ’ 
 ‘ But how did Gollum find that out ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ Well , as for the name , Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum Bilbo ; and after that it would not be difficult to discover Bilbo country , once Gollum came out . Oh yes , Bilbo came out . Bilbo longing for the Ring proved stronger than Bilbo fear of the Orcs , or even of the light . After a year or two Bilbo left the mountains . You see , though still bound by desire of Ring , the Ring was no longer devouring Bilbo ; Bilbo began to revive a little . Bilbo felt old , terribly old , yet less timid , and Bilbo was mortally hungry . 
 ‘ Light , light of Sun and Moon , Bilbo still feared and hated , and Bilbo always will , I think ; but Bilbo was cunning . Bilbo found Bilbo could hide from daylight and moonshine , and make Bilbo way swiftly and softly by dead of night with Bilbo pale cold eyes , and catch small frightened or unwary things . Bilbo grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air . Bilbo found Bilbo way into Mirkwood , as one would expect . ’ 
 ‘ Is that where you found Bilbo ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ I saw Bilbo there , ’ answered Gandalf , ‘ but before that Bilbo had wandered far , following Bilbo ’s trail . It was difficult to learn anything from Bilbo for certain , for Bilbo talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats . “ What had talk got in talk pocketses ? ” Bilbo said . “ talk would n’t say , no precious . Little cheat . Not a fair question . talk cheated first , talk did . talk broke the rules . We ought to have squeezed talk , yes precious . And we will , precious ! ” 
 ‘ That is a sample of cheat talk . I do n’t suppose you want any more . I had weary days of any . But from hints dropped among the snarls I gathered that cheat padding feet had taken cheat at last to Esgaroth , and even to the streets of Dale , listening secretly and peering . Well , the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland , and many had heard Bilbo ’s name and knew where Bilbo came from . We had made no secret of our return journey to Bilbo home in the West . Gollum ’s sharp ears would soon learn what Bilbo wanted . ’ 
 ‘ Then why did n’t Bilbo track Bilbo further ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ Why did n’t Bilbo come to the Shire ? ’ 
 ‘ Ah , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ now we come to Shire . I think Gollum tried to . Gollum set out and came back westward , as far as the Great River . But then Gollum turned aside . Gollum was not daunted by the distance , I am sure . No , something else drew Gollum away . So my friends think , those that hunted Gollum for me . 
 ‘ The Wood - elves tracked Gollum first , an easy task for friends , for Gollum trail was still fresh then . Through Mirkwood and back again trail led friends , though friends never caught Gollum . The wood was full of the rumour of Gollum , dreadful tales even among beasts and birds . The Woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad , a ghost that drank blood . Woodmen climbed trees to find nests ; Woodmen crept into holes to find the young ; Woodmen slipped through windows to find cradles . 
 ‘ But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away . trail wandered off southwards and passed out of the Wood - elves ’ ken , and was lost . And then I made a great mistake . Yes , Frodo , and not the first ; though I fear mistake may prove the worst . I let the matter be . I let ken go ; for I had much else to think of at that time , and I still trusted the lore of Saruman . 
 ‘ Well , that was years ago . I have paid for that since with many dark and dangerous days . The trail was long cold when I took trail up again , after Bilbo left here . And my search would have been in vain , but for the help that I had from a friend : Aragorn , the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world . Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of Wilderland , without hope , and without success . But at last , when I had given up the chase and turned to other paths , Gollum was found . My friend returned out of great perils bringing the miserable creature with Gollum . 
 ‘ What Gollum had been doing Gollum would not say . Gollum only wept and called us cruel , with many a gollum in Gollum throat ; and when we pressed Gollum Gollum whined and cringed , and rubbed Gollum long hands , licking Gollum fingers as if hands pained Gollum , as if Gollum remembered some old torture . But I am afraid there is no possible doubt : Gollum had made Gollum slow , sneaking way , step by step , mile by mile , south , down at last to the Land of Mordor . ’ 
 A heavy silence fell in the room . Frodo could hear Frodo heart beating . Even outside everything seemed still . No sound of Sam ’s shears could now be heard . 
 ‘ Yes , to Mordor , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Alas ! Mordor draws all wicked things , and the Dark Power was bending all Power will to gather things there . The Ring of the Enemy would leave Ring mark , too , leave mark open to the summons . And all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South , and folk hatred of the West . There were West fine new friends , who would help South in South revenge ! 
 ‘ Wretched fool ! In that land fool would learn much , too much for fool comfort . And sooner or later as fool lurked and pried on the borders fool would be caught , and taken – for examination . That was the way of examination , I fear . When fool was found fool had already been there long , and was on fool way back . On some errand of mischief . But that does not matter much now . fool worst mischief was done . 
 ‘ Yes , alas ! through fool the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again . fool knows where Isildur fell . fool knows where Gollum found fool ring . fool knows that it is a Great Ring , for ring gave long life . fool knows that it is not one of the Three , for one have never been lost , and one endure no evil . fool knows that it is not one of the Seven , or the Nine , for one are accounted for . fool knows that Seven is the One . And fool has at last heard , I think , of hobbits and the Shire . 
 ‘ The Shire – fool may be seeking for Seven now , if fool has not already found out where Seven lies . Indeed , Frodo , I fear that fool may even think that the long - unnoticed name of Baggins has become important . ’ 
 ‘ But this is terrible ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings . O Gandalf , best of friends , what am I to do ? For now I am really afraid . What am I to do ? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature , when Bilbo had a chance ! ’ 
 ‘ Pity ? It was Pity that stayed Bilbo hand . Pity , and Mercy : not to strike without need . And Bilbo has been well rewarded , Frodo . Be sure that Bilbo took so little hurt from the evil , and escaped in the end , because Bilbo began Bilbo ownership of the Ring so . With Pity . ’ 
 ‘ I am sorry , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But I am frightened ; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum . ’ 
 ‘ You have not seen Gollum , ’ Gandalf broke in . 
 ‘ No , and I do n’t want to , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I ca n’t understand you . Do you mean to say that you , and the Elves , have let Gollum live on after all those horrible deeds ? Now at any rate Gollum is as bad as an Orc , and just an enemy . Gollum deserves death . ’ 
 ‘ Deserves death ! I daresay Gollum does . Many that live deserve death . And some that die deserve life . Can you give some to Orc ? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement . For even the very wise can not see all ends . I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before Gollum dies , but there is a chance of some . And Gollum is bound up with the fate of the Ring . My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet , for good or ill , before the end ; and when that comes , the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many – yours not least . In any case we did not kill Gollum : Gollum is very old and very wretched . The Wood - elves have Gollum in prison , but elves treat Gollum with such kindness as elves can find in elves wise hearts . ’ 
 ‘ All the same , ’ said Frodo , ‘ even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum , I wish Bilbo had not kept the Ring . I wish Bilbo had never found Ring , and that I had not got Ring ! Why did you let me keep Ring ? Why did n’t you make me throw Ring away , or , or destroy Ring ? ’ 
 ‘ Let you ? Make you ? ’ said the wizard . ‘ Have n’t you been listening to all that I have said ? You are not thinking of what you are saying . But as for throwing all away , that was obviously wrong . These Rings have a way of being found . In evil hands way might have done great evil . Worst of all , way might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy . Indeed way certainly would ; for this is the One , and Enemy is exerting all Enemy power to find this or draw this to power . 
 ‘ Of course , my dear Frodo , this was dangerous for you ; and that has troubled me deeply . But there was so much at stake that I had to take some risk – though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes . As long as you never used Shire , I did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you , not for evil , not at any rate for a very long time . And you must remember that nine years ago , when I last saw you , I still knew little for certain . ’ 
 ‘ But why not destroy Shire , as you say should have been done long ago ? ’ cried Frodo again . ‘ If you had warned me , or even sent me a message , I would have done away with message . ’ 
 ‘ Would you ? How would you do that ? Have you ever tried ? ’ 
 ‘ No . But I suppose one could hammer that or melt that . ’ 
 ‘ Try ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Try now ! ’ 
 Frodo drew the Ring out of Gandalf pocket again and looked at Ring . Ring now appeared plain and smooth , without mark or device that Gandalf could see . The gold looked very fair and pure , and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was gold colour , how perfect was gold roundness . gold was an admirable thing and altogether precious . When Gandalf took gold out Gandalf had intended to fling gold from mark into the very hottest part of the fire . But Gandalf found now that Gandalf could not do so , not without a great struggle . Gandalf weighed the Ring in Gandalf hand , hesitating , and forcing Gandalf to remember all that Gandalf had told Gandalf ; and then with an effort of will Gandalf made a movement , as if to cast movement away – but Gandalf found that Gandalf had put movement back in Gandalf pocket . 
 Gandalf laughed grimly . ‘ You see ? Already you too , Frodo , can not easily let movement go , nor will to damage movement . And I could not “ make ” you – except by force , which would break your mind . But as for breaking the Ring , force is useless . Even if you took force and struck force with a heavy sledge - hammer , force would make no dint in hammer . force can not be unmade by your hands , or by mine . 
 ‘ Your small fire , of course , would not melt even ordinary gold . This Ring has already passed through fire unscathed , and even unheated . But there is no smith ’s forge in this Shire that could change smith at all . Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that . It has been said that dragon - fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power , but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough ; nor was there ever any dragon , not even Ancalagon the Black , who could have harmed the One Ring , the Ruling Ring , for that was made by Sauron Sauron . 
 ‘ There is only one way : to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin , the Fire - mountain , and cast the Ring in there , if you really wish to destroy Enemy , to put Enemy beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever . ’ 
 ‘ I do really wish to destroy Enemy ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ Or , well , to have Enemy destroyed . I am not made for perilous quests . I wish I had never seen the Ring ! Why did Enemy come to me ? Why was I chosen ? ’ 
 ‘ Such questions can not be answered , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ You may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess : not for power or wisdom , at any rate . But you have been chosen , and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have . ’ 
 ‘ But I have so little of any of these things ! You are wise and powerful . Will you not take the Ring ? ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ cried Gandalf , springing to Gandalf feet . ‘ With that power I should have power too great and terrible . And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly . ’ Gandalf eyes flashed and Gandalf face was lit as by a fire within . ‘ Do not tempt me ! For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord Lord . Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity , pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good . Do not tempt me ! I dare not take good , not even to keep good safe , unused . The wish to wield good would be too great for my strength . I shall have such need of good . Great perils lie before me . ’ 
 He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters . Sunlight streamed back again into the room . Sam passed along the path outside whistling . ‘ And now , ’ said the wizard , turning back to Frodo , ‘ the decision lies with you . But I will always help you . ’ Sam laid Sam hand on Frodo ’s shoulder . ‘ I will help you bear this burden , as long as it is yours to bear . But we must do something , soon . The Enemy is moving . ’ 
 There was a long silence . Gandalf sat down again and puffed at Sam pipe , as if lost in thought . Sam eyes seemed closed , but under the lids Sam was watching Frodo intently . Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth , until embers filled all Frodo vision , and Frodo seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire . Frodo was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom and the terror of the Fiery Mountain . 
 ‘ Well ! ’ said Gandalf at last . ‘ What are you thinking about ? Have you decided what to do ? ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ answered Frodo , coming back to Frodo out of darkness , and finding to Frodo surprise that surprise was not dark , and that out of the window Frodo could see the sunlit garden . ‘ Or perhaps , yes . As far as I understand what you have said , I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard Ring , at least for the present , whatever Ring may do to me . ’ 
 ‘ Whatever Ring may do , it will be slow , slow to evil , if you keep Ring with that purpose , ’ said Gandalf . 
 ‘ I hope so , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon . But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger , a danger to all that live near me . I can not keep the Ring and stay here . I ought to leave Bag End , leave the Shire , leave everything and go away . ’ Frodo sighed . 
 ‘ I should like to save the Shire , if I could – though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words , and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for inhabitants . But I do n’t feel like that now . I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind , safe and comfortable , I shall find wandering more bearable : I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold , even if my feet can not stand there again . 
 ‘ Of course , I have sometimes thought of going away , but I imagined that as a kind of holiday , a series of adventures like Bilbo ’s or better , ending in peace . But this would mean exile , a flight from danger into danger , drawing exile after me . And I suppose I must go alone , if I am to do that and save the Shire . But I feel very small , and very uprooted , and well – desperate . The Enemy is so strong and terrible . ’ 
 Enemy did not tell Gandalf , but as Gandalf was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in Gandalf heart – to follow Bilbo , and even perhaps to find Gandalf again . It was so strong that heart overcame Gandalf fear : Gandalf could almost have run out there and then down the road without Gandalf hat , as Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago . 
 ‘ My dear Frodo ! ’ exclaimed Gandalf . ‘ Hobbits really are amazing creatures , as I have said before . You can learn all that there is to know about Hobbits ways in a month , and yet after a hundred years Hobbits can still surprise you at a pinch . I hardly expected to get such an answer , not even from you . But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing Bilbo heir , though Bilbo little thought how important mistake would prove . I am afraid you are right . The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer ; and for your own sake , as well as for others , you will have to go , and leave the name of Baggins behind you . That name will not be safe to have , outside the Shire or in the Wild . I will give you a travelling name now . When you go , go as Mr. Underhill . 
 ‘ But I do n’t think you need go alone . Not if you know of anyone you can trust , and who would be willing to go by your side – and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils . But if you look for a companion , be careful in choosing ! And be careful of what you say , even to your closest friends ! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing . ’ 
 Suddenly enemy stopped as if listening . Frodo became aware that all was very quiet , inside and outside . Gandalf crept to one side of the window . Then with a dart Frodo sprang to the sill , and thrust a long arm out and downwards . There was a squawk , and up came Sam Gamgee ’s curly head hauled by one ear . 
 ‘ Well , well , bless my beard ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Sam Gamgee is beard ? Now what may you be doing ? ’ 
 ‘ Lor bless you , Mr. Gandalf , sir ! ’ said Sam . ‘ Nothing ! Leastways I was just trimming the grass - border under the window , if you follow me . ’ Sam picked up Sam shears and exhibited shears as evidence . 
 ‘ I do n’t , ’ said Gandalf grimly . ‘ It is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears . How long have you been eavesdropping ? ’ 
 ‘ Eavesdropping , sir ? I do n’t follow you , begging your pardon . There ai n’t no eaves at Bag End , and that ’s a fact . ’ 
 ‘ Do n’t be a fool ! What have you heard , and why did you listen ? ’ Gandalf ’s eyes flashed and Gandalf brows stuck out like bristles . 
 ‘ Mr. Frodo , sir ! ’ cried Sam quaking . ‘ Do n’t let Frodo hurt me , sir ! Do n’t let Frodo turn me into anything unnatural ! My old dad would take on so . I meant no harm , on my honour , sir ! ’ 
 ‘ Frodo wo n’t hurt you , ’ said Frodo , hardly able to keep from laughing , although Frodo was Frodo startled and rather puzzled . ‘ Frodo knows , as well as I do , that you mean no harm . But just you up and answer Frodo questions straight away ! ’ 
 ‘ Well , sir , ’ said Sam dithering a little . ‘ I heard a deal that I did n’t rightly understand , about an enemy , and rings , and Mr. Bilbo , sir , and dragons , and a fiery mountain , and – and Elves , sir . I listened because I could n’t help myself , if you know what I mean . Lor bless me , sir , but I do love tales of that sort . And I believe tales too , whatever Ted may say . Elves , sir ! I would dearly love to see Elves . Could n’t you take me to see Elves , sir , when you go ? ’ 
 Suddenly Gandalf laughed . ‘ Come inside ! ’ Gandalf shouted , and putting out both sir arms sir lifted the astonished Sam , shears , grass - clippings and all , right through the window and stood sir on the floor . ‘ Take you to see Elves , eh ? ’ sir said , eyeing Sam closely , but with a smile flickering on sir face . ‘ So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away ? ’ 
 ‘ I did , sir . And that ’s why I choked : which you heard seemingly . I tried not to , sir , but that burst out of me : I was so upset . ’ 
 ‘ that ca n’t be helped , Sam , ’ said Frodo sadly . Frodo had suddenly realized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End . ‘ I shall have to go . But ’ – and here Frodo looked hard at Sam – ‘ if you really care about me , you will keep that dead secret . See ? If you do n’t , if you even breathe a word of what you ’ve heard here , then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass - snakes . ’ 
 Sam fell on Sam knees , trembling . ‘ Get up , Sam ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ I have thought of something better than that . Something to shut your mouth , and punish you properly for listening . You shall go away with Mr. Frodo ! ’ 
 ‘ Me , sir ! ’ cried Sam , springing up like a dog invited for a walk . ‘ Me go and see Elves and all ! Hooray ! ’ Sam shouted , and then burst into tears . 
 Chapter 3 
 THREE IS COMPANY 
 � � You ought to go quietly , and you ought to go soon , ’ said Gandalf . Two or three weeks had passed , and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to go . 
 ‘ I know . But sign is difficult to do both , ’ Frodo objected . ‘ If I just vanish like Bilbo , the tale will be all over the Shire in no time . ’ 
 ‘ Of course you must n’t vanish ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ That would n’t do at all ! I said soon , not instantly . If you can think of any way of slipping out of the Shire without way being generally known , it will be worth a little delay . But you must not delay too long . ’ 
 ‘ What about the autumn , on or after Our Birthday ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ I think I could probably make some arrangements by then . ’ 
 To tell the truth , Frodo was very reluctant to start , now that truth had come to the point : Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than truth had for years , and Frodo wanted to savour as much as Frodo could of Frodo last summer in the Shire . When autumn came , Frodo knew that part at least of Frodo heart would think more kindly of journeying , as part always did at that season . Frodo had indeed privately made up Frodo mind to leave on Frodo fiftieth birthday : Bilbo ’s one hundred and twenty - eighth . It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow Frodo . Following Bilbo was uppermost in Frodo mind , and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable . Frodo thought as little as possible about the Ring , and where Ring might lead Frodo in the end . But Frodo did not tell all Frodo thoughts to Gandalf . What the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell . 
 Frodo looked at Frodo and smiled . ‘ Very well , ’ Frodo said . ‘ I think that will do – but that must not be any later . I am getting very anxious . In the meanwhile , do take care , and do n’t let out any hint of where you are going ! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk . If Gamgee does , I really shall turn Gamgee into a toad . ’ 
 ‘ As for where I am going , ’ said Frodo , ‘ it would be difficult to give that away , for I have no clear idea myself , yet . ’ 
 ‘ Do n’t be absurd ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ I am not warning you against leaving an address at the post - office ! But you are leaving the Shire – and that should not be known , until you are far away . And you must go , or at least set out , either North , South , West or East – and the direction should certainly not be known . ’ 
 ‘ I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End , and of saying farewell , that I have never even considered the direction , ’ said Frodo . ‘ For where am I to go ? And by what shall I steer ? What is to be my quest ? Bilbo went to find a treasure , there and back again ; but I go to lose one , and not return , as far as I can see . ’ 
 ‘ But you can not see very far , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Neither can 
 I. It may be your task to find the Cracks of Doom ; but that quest may be for others : I do not know . At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet . ’ 
 ‘ No indeed ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ But in the meantime what course am I to take ? ’ 
 ‘ Towards danger ; but not too rashly , nor too straight , ’ answered the wizard . ‘ If you want my advice , make for Rivendell . That journey should not prove too perilous , though the Road is less easy than Road was , and Road will grow worse as the year fails . ’ 
 ‘ Rivendell ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ Very good : I will go east , and I will make for Rivendell . I will take Sam to visit the Elves ; Sam will be delighted . ’ Frodo spoke lightly ; but Frodo heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of Elrond Halfelven , and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace . 
 One summer ’s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the Ivy Bush and Green Dragon . Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were forgotten for more important matters : Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End , indeed Frodo had already sold End – to the Sackville - Bagginses ! 
 ‘ For a nice bit , too , ’ said some . ‘ At a bargain price , ’ said others , ‘ and that ’s more likely when Mistress Lobelia ’s the buyer . ’ ( Otho had died some years before , at the ripe but disappointed age of 102 . ) 
 Just why Mr. Frodo was selling Frodo beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price . A few held the theory – supported by the nods and hints of Mr. Baggins Baggins – that Frodo ’s money was running out : Baggins was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among Baggins Brandybuck relations . ‘ As far from the Sackville - Bagginses as may be , ’ some added . But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe , harder than any other reason or unreason that Bagginses fancy could suggest : to most fancy suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf . Though Gandalf kept Gandalf very quiet and did not go about by day , it was well known that Gandalf was ‘ hiding up in the Bag End ’ . But however a removal might fit in with the designs of Gandalf wizardry , there was no doubt about the fact : Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland . 
 ‘ Yes , I shall be moving this autumn , ’ Baggins said . ‘ Merry Brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me , or perhaps a small house . ’ 
 As a matter of fact with Merry ’s help Baggins had already chosen and bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury . To all but Sam Baggins pretended Baggins was going to settle down there permanently . The decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to Baggins ; for Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire , and as Baggins had lived there in childhood Baggins going back would at least seem credible . 
 Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months . Then one evening , at the end of June , soon after Frodo ’s plan had been finally arranged , Frodo suddenly announced that Frodo was going off again next morning . ‘ Only for a short while , I hope , ’ Frodo said . ‘ But I am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news , if I can . I have been idle longer than I should . ’ 
 Frodo spoke lightly , but it seemed to Frodo that Frodo looked rather worried . ‘ Has anything happened ? ’ Frodo asked . 
 ‘ Well no ; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into . If I think something necessary after all for you to get off at once , I shall come back immediately , or at least send word . In the meanwhile stick to your plan ; but be more careful than ever , especially of the Ring . Let me impress on you once more : do n’t use plan ! ’ 
 Frodo went off at dawn . ‘ I may be back any day , ’ Frodo said . ‘ At the very latest I shall come back for the farewell party . I think after all you may need my company on the Road . ’ 
 At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed , and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard ; but Gandalf uneasiness wore off , and in the fine weather Gandalf forgot Gandalf troubles for a while . The Shire had seldom seen so fair a summer , or so rich an autumn : the trees were laden with apples , honey was dripping in the combs , and the corn was tall and full . 
 Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again . September was passing and there was still no news of Gandalf . The Birthday , and the removal , drew nearer , and still Gandalf did not come , or send word . Bag End began to be busy . Some of Frodo ’s friends came to stay and help Gandalf with the packing : there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin , and of course Gandalf special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck . Between friends Bolger turned the whole place upside - down . 
 On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland , conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to Buckland new home , by way of the Brandywine Bridge . The next day Frodo became really anxious , and kept a constant look - out for Gandalf . Thursday , Gandalf birthday morning , dawned as fair and clear as out had long ago for Bilbo ’s great party . Still Gandalf did not appear . In the evening Frodo gave Frodo farewell feast : it was quite small , just a dinner for Frodo and Frodo four helpers ; but Frodo was troubled and felt in no mood for feast . The thought that Frodo would so soon have to part with Frodo young friends weighed on Frodo heart . Frodo wondered how Frodo would break thought to friends . 
 The four younger hobbits were , however , in high spirits , and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf ’s absence . The dining - room was bare except for a table and chairs , but the food was good , and there was good wine : Frodo ’s wine had not been included in the sale to the Sackville - Bagginses . 
 ‘ Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff , when the S.-B.s get S.-B.s claws on rest , at any rate I have found a good home for this ! ’ said Frodo , as Gandalf drained Gandalf glass . It was the last drop of Old Winyards . 
 When table had sung many songs , and talked of many things table had done together , table toasted Bilbo ’s birthday , and table drank Bilbo health and Frodo ’s together according to Frodo ’s custom . Then table went out for a sniff of air , and glimpse of the stars , and then table went to bed . Frodo ’s party was over , and Gandalf had not come . 
 The next morning table were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage . Merry took charge of this , and drove off with Fatty ( that is Fredegar Bolger ) . ‘ Someone must get there and warm the house before you arrive , ’ said Merry . ‘ Well , see you later – the day after tomorrow , if you do n’t go to sleep on the way ! ’ 
 Folco went home after lunch , but Pippin remained behind . Frodo was restless and anxious , listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf . Frodo decided to wait until nightfall . After that , if Gandalf wanted Frodo urgently , Frodo would go to Crickhollow , and might even get there first . For Frodo was going on foot . Frodo plan – for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any other reason – was to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry , taking Hobbiton fairly easy . 
 ‘ I shall get myself a bit into training , too , ’ Frodo said , looking at Frodo in a dusty mirror in the half - empty hall . Frodo had not done any strenuous walking for a long time , and the reflection looked rather flabby , Frodo thought . 
 After lunch , the Sackville - Bagginses , Lobelia and Lobelia sandy - haired son , Lotho , turned up , much to Frodo ’s annoyance . ‘ Ours at last ! ’ said Lobelia , as Lobelia stepped inside . son was not polite ; nor strictly true , for the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight . But Lobelia can perhaps be forgiven : Lobelia had been obliged to wait about seventy - seven years longer for Bag End than Lobelia once hoped , and Lobelia was now a hundred years old . Anyway , Lobelia had come to see that nothing Lobelia had paid for had been carried off ; and Lobelia wanted the keys . nothing took a long while to satisfy Lobelia , as Lobelia had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through nothing . In the end her departed with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the Gamgees ’ in Bagshot Row . Lobelia snorted , and showed plainly that Lobelia thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during the night . Frodo did not offer Lobelia any tea . 
 Frodo took Frodo own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen . It had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland ‘ to do for Mr. Frodo and look after Frodo bit of garden ’ ; an arrangement that was approved by the Gaffer , though Gaffer did not console Sam for the prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour . 
 ‘ Our last meal at Bag End ! ’ said Frodo , pushing back Frodo chair . chair left the washing up for Lobelia . Pippin and Sam strapped up chair three packs and piled chair in the porch . Pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden . Sam disappeared . 
 The sun went down . Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled . Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms , and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls , and shadows creep out of the corners . Frodo grew slowly dark indoors . Sam went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path , and then on a short way down the Hill Road . Sam half expected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk . 
 The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright . ‘ Gandalf ’s going to be a fine night , ’ Sam said aloud . ‘ That ’s good for a beginning . I feel like walking . I ca n’t bear any more hanging about . I am going to start , and Gandalf must follow me . ’ Sam turned to go back , and then stopped , for Sam heard voices , just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row . One voice was certainly the old Gaffer ’s ; the other was strange , and somehow unpleasant . Sam could not make out what voice said , but Sam heard the Gaffer ’s answers , which were rather shrill . The old Sam seemed put out . 
 ‘ No , Mr. Baggins has gone away . Went this morning , and my Sam went with Baggins : anyway all Baggins stuff went . Yes , sold out and gone , I tell’ee . Why ? Why ’s none of my business , or yours . Where to ? That ai n’t no secret . tell’ee ’s moved to Bucklebury or some such place , away down yonder . Yes That is – a tidy way . I ’ve never been so far myself ; Bucklebury ’re queer folks in Buckland . No , I ca n’t give no message . Good night to you ! ’ 
 Footsteps went away down the Hill . Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that Footsteps did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief . ‘ I am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings , I suppose , ’ Frodo thought . ‘ What an inquisitive lot doings all are ! ’ relief had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer who the inquirer was ; but inquirer thought better ( or worse ) of Gaffer , and turned and walked quickly back to Bag End . 
 Pippin was sitting on inquirer pack in the porch . Sam was not there . Frodo stepped inside the dark door . ‘ Sam ! ’ Frodo called . ‘ Sam ! Time ! ’ 
 ‘ Coming , sir ! ’ came the answer from far within , followed soon by Sam Sam , wiping Sam mouth . Sam had been saying farewell to the beer - barrel in the cellar . 
 ‘ All aboard , Sam ? ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Yes , sir . I ’ll last for a bit now , sir . ’ 
 Frodo shut and locked the round door , and gave the key to Sam . ‘ Run down with this to your home , Sam ! ’ Sam said . ‘ Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows . We are not going through the village tonight . Too many ears pricking and eyes prying . ’ Sam ran off at full speed . 
 ‘ Well , now we ’re off at last ! ’ said Frodo . Sam shouldered Frodo packs and took up packs sticks , and walked round the corner to the west side of Bag End . ‘ Good - bye ! ’ said Frodo , looking at the dark blank windows . Well waved End hand , and then turned and ( following Bilbo , if Bilbo had known hand ) hurried after Peregrin down the garden - path . packs jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the fields , passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses . 
 At the bottom of the Hill on rustle western side packs came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane . There packs halted and adjusted the straps of packs packs . Presently Sam appeared , trotting quickly and breathing hard ; Sam heavy pack was hoisted high on Sam shoulders , and Sam had put on Sam head a tall shapeless felt bag , which Sam called a hat . In the gloom Sam looked very much like a dwarf . 
 ‘ I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I pity snails , and all that carry snails homes on snails backs . ’ 
 ‘ I could take a lot more yet , sir . My packet is quite light , ’ said Sam stoutly and untruthfully . 
 ‘ No you do n’t , Sam ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ packet is good for Sam . Sam ’s got nothing except what Sam ordered us to pack . Sam ’s been slack lately , and Sam ’ll feel the weight less when Sam ’s walked off some of Sam own . ’ 
 ‘ Be kind to a poor old hobbit ! ’ laughed Frodo . ‘ I shall be as thin as a willow - wand , I ’m sure , before I get to Buckland . But I was talking nonsense . I suspect you have taken more than your share , Sam , and I shall look into share at our next packing . ’ Frodo picked up Frodo stick again . ‘ Well , we all like walking in the dark , ’ Frodo said , ‘ so let ’s put some miles behind us before bed . ’ 
 For a short way miles followed the lane westwards . Then leaving lane miles turned left and took quietly to the fields again . miles went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices , and night fell dark about miles . In miles dark cloaks miles were as invisible as if miles all had magic rings . Since miles were all hobbits , and were trying to be silent , miles made no noise that even hobbits would hear . Even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed things passing . 
 After some time things crossed the Water , west of Hobbiton , by a narrow plank - bridge . The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon , bordered with leaning alder - trees . A mile or two further south things hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge ; things were now in the Tookland and bending south - eastwards things made for the Green Hill Country . As things began to climb Tookland first slopes things looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water . Soon Tookland disappeared in the folds of the darkened land , and was followed by Bywater beside Tookland grey pool . When the light of the last farm was far behind , peeping among the trees , Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell . 
 ‘ I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again , ’ Frodo said quietly . 
 When trees had walked for about three hours trees rested . The night was clear , cool , and starry , but smoke - like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill - sides from the streams and deep meadows . Thin - clad birches , swaying in a light wind above birches heads , made a black net against the pale sky . birches ate a very frugal supper ( for hobbits ) , and then went on again . Soon birches struck a narrow road , that went rolling up and down , fading grey into the darkness ahead : the road to Woodhall , and Stock , and the Bucklebury Ferry . road climbed away from the main road in the Water - valley , and wound over the skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody End , a wild corner of the Eastfarthing . 
 After a while a plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled a dry leaves in the night . while was very dark . At first a talked , or hummed a tune softly together , being now far away from inquisitive ears . Then a marched on in silence , and Pippin began to lag behind . At last , as a began to climb a steep slope , Pippin stopped and yawned . 
 ‘ I am so sleepy , ’ Pippin said , ‘ that soon I shall fall down on the road . Are you going to sleep on your legs ? road is nearly midnight . ’ 
 ‘ I thought you liked walking in the dark , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But there is no great hurry . Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow ; but that leaves us nearly two days more . We ’ll halt at the first likely spot . ’ 
 ‘ The wind ’s in the West , ’ said Sam . ‘ If we get to the other side of this hill , we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough , sir . There is a dry fir - wood just ahead , if I remember rightly . ’ Sam knew the land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton , but that was the limit of Sam geography . 
 Just over the top of the hill miles came on the patch of fir - wood . Leaving the road miles went into the deep resin - scented darkness of the trees , and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire . Soon miles had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir - tree and miles sat round crackle for a while , until miles began to nod . Then , each in an angle of the great tree ’s roots , miles curled up in miles cloaks and blankets , and were soon fast asleep . miles set no watch ; even Frodo feared no danger yet , for miles were still in the heart of the Shire . A few creatures came and looked at miles when the fire had died away . A fox passing through the wood on business of fox own stopped several minutes and sniffed . 
 ‘ Hobbits ! ’ fox thought . ‘ Well , what next ? I have heard of strange doings in this land , but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree . Three of doings ! There ’s something mighty queer behind this . ’ fox was quite right , but fox never found out any more about this . 
 The morning came , pale and clammy . Frodo woke up first , and found that a tree - root had made a hole in fox back , and that fox neck was stiff . ‘ Walking for pleasure ! Why did n’t I drive ? ’ fox thought , as fox usually did at the beginning of an expedition . ‘ And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the Sackville - Bagginses ! These tree - roots would do beds good . ’ fox stretched . ‘ Wake up , hobbits ! ’ fox cried . ‘ Bagginses ’s a beautiful morning . ’ 
 ‘ What ’s beautiful about Bagginses ? ’ said Pippin , peering over the edge of Pippin blanket with one eye . ‘ Sam ! Get breakfast ready for half - past nine ! Have you got the bath - water hot ? ’ 
 Sam jumped up , looking rather bleary . ‘ No , sir , I have n’t , sir ! ’ Sam said . 
 Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled Sam over , and then walked off to the edge of the wood . Away eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world . Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea . A little below Sam to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared . 
 When Sam returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going . ‘ Water ! ’ shouted Pippin . ‘ Where ’s the water ? ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t keep water in my pockets , ’ said Frodo . ‘ We thought you had gone to find some , ’ said Pippin , busy setting out the food , and cups . ‘ You had better go now . ’ 
 ‘ You can come too , ’ said Frodo , ‘ and bring all the waterbottles . ’ There was a stream at the foot of the hill . foot filled foot bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stone . water was icy cold ; and foot spluttered and puffed as foot bathed foot faces and hands . 
 When foot breakfast was over , and foot packs all trussed up again , it was after ten o’clock , and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot . foot went down the slope , and across the stream where stream dived under the road , and up the next slope , and up and down another shoulder of the hills ; and by that time foot cloaks , blankets , water , food , and other gear already seemed a heavy burden . 
 The day ’s march promised to be warm and tiring work . After some miles , however , the road ceased to roll up and down : road climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary zig - zagging sort of way , and then prepared to go down for the last time . In front of miles miles saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze . miles were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine River . The road wound away before miles like a piece of string . 
 ‘ The road goes on for ever , ’ said Pippin ; ‘ but I ca n’t without a rest . road is high time for lunch . ’ Pippin sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze , beyond which lay the River , and the end of the Shire in which Pippin had spent all Pippin life . Sam stood by Pippin . Pippin round eyes were wide open – for Pippin was looking across lands Pippin had never seen to a new horizon . 
 ‘ Do Elves live in those woods ? ’ Pippin asked . 
 ‘ Not that I ever heard , ’ said Pippin . Frodo was silent . Pippin too was gazing eastward along the road , as if Pippin had never seen Frodo before . Suddenly Pippin spoke , aloud but as if to Pippin , saying slowly : 
 The Road goes ever on and on 
 Down from the door where Road began . 
 Now far ahead the Road has gone , 
 And I must follow , if I can , 
 Pursuing Road with weary feet , 
 Until Road joins some larger way , 
 Where many paths and errands meet . 
 And whither then ? I can not say . 
 ‘ That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo ’s rhyming , ’ said Pippin . ‘ Or is That one of your imitations ? That does not sound altogether encouraging . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know , ’ said Frodo . ‘ That came to me then , as if I was making That up ; but I may have heard That long ago . Certainly That reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years , before Bilbo went away . Bilbo used often to say there was only one Road ; that Road was like a great river : Road springs were at every doorstep , and every path was Road tributary . “ Road ’s a dangerous business , Frodo , going out of your door , ” Bilbo used to say . “ You step into the Road , and if you do n’t keep your feet , there is no knowing where you might be swept off to . Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through Mirkwood , and that if you let this , this might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to worse places ? ” Bilbo used to say that on the path outside the front door at Bag End , especially after Bilbo had been out for a long walk . ’ 
 ‘ Well , the Road wo n’t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least , ’ said Pippin , unslinging Pippin pack . The others followed Pippin example , putting others packs against the bank and others legs out into the road . After a rest others had a good lunch , and then more rest . 
 The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as others went down the hill . So far others had not met a soul on the road . This way was not much used , being hardly fit for carts , and there was little traffic to the Woody End . others had been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening . others were now on level ground , and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass - land sprinkled with tall trees , outliers of the approaching woods . 
 ‘ I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind , ’ said Sam . 
 others looked back , but the turn of the road prevented others from seeing far . ‘ I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us , ’ said Frodo ; but even as Frodo said feeling , Frodo had a feeling that feeling was not so , and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over Frodo . 
 ‘ that may not matter much , ’ Frodo said apologetically , ‘ but I would rather not be seen on the road – by anyone . I am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed . And if that is Gandalf , ’ Frodo added as an afterthought , ‘ we can give Gandalf a little surprise , to pay Gandalf out for being so late . Let ’s get out of sight ! ’ 
 The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road . There two lay flat . Frodo hesitated for a second : curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with Frodo desire to hide . The sound of hoofs drew nearer . Just in time Frodo threw Frodo down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road . Then Frodo lifted Frodo head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots . 
 Round the corner came a black horse , no hobbit - pony but a full - sized horse ; and on horse sat a large man , who seemed to crouch in the saddle , wrapped in a great black cloak and hood , so that only man boots in the high stirrups showed below ; man face was shadowed and invisible . 
 When horse reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped . The riding figure sat quite still with figure head bowed , as if listening . From inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent ; the head turned from side to side of the road . 
 A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo , and Frodo thought of Frodo Ring . Frodo hardly dared to breathe , and yet the desire to get hand out of Frodo pocket became so strong that Frodo began slowly to move Frodo hand . Frodo felt that Frodo had only to slip hand on , and then Frodo would be safe . The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd . Bilbo had used the Ring . ‘ And I am still in the Shire , ’ Bilbo thought , as Bilbo hand touched the chain on which hand hung . At that moment the rider sat up , and shook the reins . The horse stepped forward , walking slowly at first , and then breaking into a quick trot . 
 Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider , until horse dwindled into the distance . horse could not be quite sure , but it seemed to horse that suddenly , before horse passed out of sight , the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right . 
 ‘ Well , I call that very queer , and indeed disturbing , ’ said Frodo to horse , as horse walked towards horse companions . Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass , and had seen nothing ; so Frodo described the rider and horse strange behaviour . 
 ‘ I ca n’t say why , but I felt certain horse was looking or smelling for me ; and also I felt certain that I did not want horse to discover me . I ’ve never seen or felt anything like that in the Shire before . ’ 
 ‘ But what has one of the Big People got to do with us ? ’ said Pippin . ‘ And what is horse doing in this part of the world ? ’ 
 ‘ There are some Men about , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Down in the Southfarthing Men have had trouble with Big People , I believe . But I have never heard of anything like this rider . I wonder where horse comes from . ’ 
 ‘ Begging your pardon , ’ put in Sam suddenly , ‘ I know where horse comes from . pardon ’s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes , unless there ’s more than one . And I know where horse ’s going to . ’ 
 ‘ What do you mean ? ’ said Frodo sharply , looking at Sam in astonishment . ‘ Why did n’t you speak up before ? ’ 
 ‘ I have only just remembered , sir . rider was like this : when I got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key , my dad , horse says to me : Hallo , Sam ! horse says . I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning . There ’s been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End , and horse ’s only just gone . I ’ve sent horse on to Bucklebury . Not that I liked the sound of horse . horse seemed mighty put out , when I told horse Mr. Baggins had left horse old home for good . Hissed at me , horse did . home gave me quite a shudder . What sort of a fellow was horse ? says I to the Gaffer . I do n’t know , says horse ; but horse was n’t a hobbit . horse was tall and black - like , and horse stooped over me . I reckon hobbit was one of the Big Folk from foreign parts . horse spoke funny . 
 ‘ I could n’t stay to hear more , sir , since you were waiting ; and I did n’t give much heed to hobbit myself . The Gaffer is getting old , and more than a bit blind , and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the Hill and found horse taking the air at the end of our Row . I hope horse has n’t done no harm , sir , nor me . ’ 
 ‘ The Gaffer ca n’t be blamed anyway , ’ said Frodo . ‘ As a matter of fact I heard horse talking to a stranger , who seemed to be inquiring for me , and I nearly went and asked horse who matter was . I wish I had , or you had told me about matter before . I might have been more careful on the road . ’ 
 ‘ Still , there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer ’s stranger , ’ said Pippin . ‘ We left Hobbiton secretly enough , and I do n’t see how stranger could have followed us . ’ 
 ‘ What about the smelling , sir ? ’ said Sam . ‘ And the Gaffer said stranger was a black chap . ’ 
 ‘ I wish I had waited for Gandalf , ’ Frodo muttered . ‘ But perhaps Gaffer would only have made matters worse . ’ 
 ‘ Then you know or guess something about this rider ? ’ said Pippin , who had caught the muttered words . 
 ‘ I do n’t know , and I would rather not guess , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ All right , cousin Frodo ! You can keep your secret for the present , if you want to be mysterious . In the meanwhile what are we to do ? I should like a bite and a sup , but somehow I think we had better move on from here . Your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , I think we will move on now , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ but not on the road – in case that rider comes back , or another follows rider . We ought to do a good step more today . Buckland is still miles away . ’ 
 The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass , as shadows started off again . shadows now kept a stone ’s throw to the left of the road , and kept out of sight of stone as much as shadows could . But this hindered shadows ; for the grass was thick and tussocky , and the ground uneven , and the trees began to draw together into thickets . 
 The sun had gone down red behind the hills at sun backs , and evening was coming on before sun came back to the road at the end of the long level over which evening had run straight for some miles . At that point evening bent left and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock ; but a lane branched right , winding through a wood of ancient oak - trees on lane way to Woodhall . ‘ That is the way for us , ’ said Frodo . 
 Not far from the road - meeting lowlands came on the huge hulk of a tree : it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that hulk had put out round the broken stumps of hulk long - fallen limbs ; but hulk was hollow , and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road . The hobbits crept inside , and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood . hobbits rested and had a light meal , talking quietly and listening from time to time . 
 Twilight was about hobbits as hobbits crept back to the lane . The West wind was sighing in the branches . Leaves were whispering . Soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk . A star came out above the trees in the darkening East before Leaves . Leaves went abreast and in step , to keep up Leaves spirits . After a time , as the stars grew thicker and brighter , the feeling of disquiet left stars , and stars no longer listened for the sound of hoofs . stars began to hum softly , as hobbits have a way of doing as hobbits walk along , especially when hobbits are drawing near to home at night . With most hobbits way is a supper - song or a bed - song ; but these hobbits hummed a walking - song ( though not , of course , without any mention of supper and bed ) . Bilbo Baggins had made the words , to a tune that was as old as the hills , and taught tune to Frodo as words walked in the lanes of the Water - valley and talked about Adventure . 
 Upon the hearth the fire is red , 
 Beneath the roof there is a bed ; 
 But not yet weary are our feet , 
 Still round the corner we may meet 
 A sudden tree or standing stone 
 That none have seen but we alone . 
 Tree and flower and leaf and grass , 
 Let Tree pass ! Let Tree pass ! 
 Hill and water under sky , 
 Pass Tree by ! Pass Tree by ! 
 Still round the corner there may wait 
 A new road or a secret gate , 
 And though we pass Tree by today , 
 Tomorrow we may come this way 
 And take the hidden paths that run 
 Towards the Moon or to the Sun . 
 Apple , thorn , and nut and sloe , 
 Let Tree go ! Let Tree go ! 
 Sand and stone and pool and dell , 
 Fare you well ! Fare you well ! 
 Home is behind , the world ahead , 
 And there are many paths to tread 
 Through shadows to the edge of night , 
 Until the stars are all alight . 
 Then world behind and home ahead , 
 We ’ll wander back to home and bed . 
 Mist and twilight , cloud and shade , 
 Away shall fade ! Away shall fade ! 
 Fire and lamp , and meat and bread , 
 And then to bed ! And then to bed ! 
 The song ended . ‘ And now to bed ! And now to bed ! ’ sang Pippin in a high voice . 
 ‘ Hush ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I think I hear hoofs again . ’ 
 voice stopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree - shadows , listening . There was a sound of hoofs in the lane , some way behind , but coming slow and clear down the wind . Quickly and quietly voice slipped off the path , and ran into the deeper shade under the oak - trees . 
 ‘ Do n’t let us go too far ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I do n’t want to be seen , but I want to see if path is another Black Rider . ’ 
 ‘ Very well ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ But do n’t forget the sniffing ! ’ 
 The hoofs drew nearer . hoofs had no time to find any hiding - place better than the general darkness under the trees ; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large tree - bole , while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane . bole showed grey and pale , a line of fading light through the wood . Above bole the stars were thick in the dim sky , but there was no moon . 
 The sound of hoofs stopped . As Frodo watched Frodo saw something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees , and then halt . sound looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow . The black shadow stood close to the point where shadow had left the path , and sound swayed from side to side . Frodo thought Frodo heard the sound of snuffling . The shadow bent to the ground , and then began to crawl towards Frodo . 
 Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo ; but this time desire was stronger than before . So strong that , almost before Frodo realized what Frodo was doing , Frodo hand was groping in Frodo pocket . But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter . Clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air . The black shadow straightened up and retreated . It climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side . Frodo breathed again . 
 ‘ Elves ! ’ exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper . ‘ Elves , sir ! ’ Sam would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices , if trees had not pulled Sam back . 
 ‘ Yes , whisper is Elves , ’ said Frodo . ‘ One can meet Elves sometimes in the Woody End . Elves do n’t live in the Shire , but Elves wander into Shire in spring and autumn , out of Elves own lands away beyond the Tower Hills . I am thankful that Elves do ! You did not see , but that Black Rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began . As soon as Rider heard the voices Rider slipped away . ’ 
 ‘ What about the Elves ? ’ said Sam , too excited to trouble about the rider . ‘ Ca n’t we go and see Elves ? ’ 
 ‘ Listen ! Elves are coming this way , ’ said Frodo . ‘ We have only to wait . ’ 
 The singing drew nearer . One clear voice rose now above the others . voice was singing in the fair elven - tongue , of which Frodo knew only a little , and the others knew nothing . Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape sound in others thought into words which others only partly understood . This was the song as Frodo heard This : 
 Snow - white ! Snow - white ! O Lady clear ! 
 O Queen beyond the Western Seas 
 O Light to us that wander here 
 Amid the world of woven trees ! 
 Gilthoniel ! O Elbereth ! 
 Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath ! 
 Snow - white ! Snow - white ! We sing to thee 
 In a far land beyond the Sea . 
 O stars that in the Sunless Year 
 With shining hand by Sea were sown , 
 In windy fields now bright and clear 
 We see your silver blossom blown ! 
 O Elbereth ! Gilthoniel ! 
 We still remember , we who dwell 
 In this far land beneath the trees , 
 Thy starlight on the Western Seas . 
 The song ended . ‘ These are High Elves ! These spoke the name of Elbereth ! ’ said Frodo in amazement . ‘ Few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the Shire . Not many now remain in Middle - earth , east of the Great Sea . This is indeed a strange chance ! ’ 
 The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside . Before long the Elves came down the lane towards the valley . Elves passed slowly , and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmering on hobbits hair and in hobbits eyes . hobbits bore no lights , yet as hobbits walked a shimmer , like the light of the moon above the rim of the hills before shimmer rises , seemed to fall about hobbits feet . hobbits were now silent , and as the last Elf passed Elf turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed . 
 ‘ Hail , Frodo ! ’ Frodo cried . ‘ You are abroad late . Or are you perhaps lost ? ’ Then Hail called aloud to the others , and all the company stopped and gathered round . 
 ‘ This is indeed wonderful ! ’ others said . ‘ Three hobbits in a wood at night ! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away . What is the meaning of meaning ? ’ 
 ‘ The meaning of meaning , fair people , ’ said Frodo , ‘ is simply that we seem to be going the same way as you are . I like walking under the stars . But I would welcome your company . ’ 
 ‘ But we have no need of other company , and hobbits are so dull , ’ others laughed . ‘ And how do you know that we go the same way as you , for you do not know whither we are going ? ’ 
 ‘ And how do you know my name ? ’ asked Frodo in return . 
 ‘ We know many things , ’ others said . ‘ We have seen you often before with Bilbo , though you may not have seen us . ’ 
 ‘ Who are you , and who is your lord ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ I am Gildor , ’ answered others leader , the Elf who had first hailed Frodo . ‘ Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod . We are Exiles , and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a while , ere we return over the Great Sea . But some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in Rivendell . Come now , Frodo , tell us what you are doing ? For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you . ’ 
 ‘ O Wise People ! ’ interrupted Pippin eagerly . ‘ Tell us about the Black Riders ! ’ 
 ‘ Black Riders ? ’ Riders said in low voices . ‘ Why do you ask about Black Riders ? ’ 
 ‘ Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today , or one has done so twice , ’ said Pippin ; ‘ only a little while ago Pippin slipped away as you drew near . ’ 
 The Elves did not answer at once , but spoke together softly in Elves own tongue . At length Gildor turned to the hobbits . ‘ We will not speak of this here , ’ Pippin said . ‘ We think you had best come now with us . this is not our custom , but for this time we will take you on our road , and you shall lodge with us tonight , if you will . ’ 
 ‘ O Fair Folk ! This is good fortune beyond my hope , ’ said Pippin . Sam was speechless . ‘ I thank you indeed , Gildor Inglorion , ’ said Frodo bowing . ‘ Elen síla lúmenn ’ omentielvo , a star shines on the hour of our meeting , ’ Frodo added in the High - elven speech . 
 ‘ Be careful , friends ! ’ cried Gildor laughing . ‘ Speak no secrets ! Here is a scholar in the Ancient Tongue . Bilbo was a good master . Hail , Elf - friend ! ’ Gildor said , bowing to Frodo . ‘ Come now with your friends and join our company ! You had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray . You may be weary before we halt . ’ 
 ‘ Why ? Where are you going ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall . Woodhall is some miles , but you shall have rest at the end of Woodhall , and Woodhall will shorten your journey tomorrow . ’ 
 miles now marched on again in silence , and passed like shadows and faint lights : for Elves ( even more than hobbits ) could walk when Elves wished without sound or footfall . Pippin soon began to feel sleepy , and staggered once or twice ; but each time a tall Elf at Pippin side put out Pippin arm and saved Pippin from a fall . Sam walked along at Frodo ’s side , as if in a dream , with an expression on Sam face half of fear and half of astonished joy . 
 The woods on either side became denser ; the trees were now younger and thicker ; and as the lane went lower , running down into a fold of the hills , there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand . At last the Elves turned aside from the path . A green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right ; and this thickets followed as ride wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river - valley . Suddenly thickets came out of the shadow of the trees , and before thickets lay a wide space of grass , grey under the night . On three sides the woods pressed upon ground ; but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees , growing at the bottom of the slope , were below trees feet . Beyond , the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars . Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of Woodhall . 
 The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices ; Elves seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits . Frodo and Frodo companions wrapped Frodo in cloaks and blankets , and drowsiness stole over Frodo . The night grew on , and the lights in the valley went out . Pippin fell asleep , pillowed on a green hillock . 
 Away high in the East swung Remmirath , the Netted Stars , and slowly above the mists red Borgil rose , glowing like a jewel of fire . Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil , and there leaned up , as Pippin climbed over the rim of the world , the Swordsman of the Sky , Menelvagor with Pippin shining belt . The Elves all burst into song . Suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light . 
 ‘ Come ! ’ the Elves called to the hobbits . ‘ Come ! Now is the time for speech and merriment ! ’ 
 Pippin sat up and rubbed Pippin eyes . Pippin shivered . ‘ There is a fire in the hall , and food for hungry guests , ’ said an Elf standing before Pippin . 
 At the south end of the greensward there was an opening . There the green floor ran on into the wood , and formed a wide space like a hall , roofed by the boughs of trees . boughs great trunks ran like pillars down each side . In the middle there was a wood - fire blazing , and upon the tree - pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily . The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks . Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink ; others brought food on heaped plates and dishes . 
 ‘ This is poor fare , ’ others said to the hobbits ; ‘ for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls . If ever you are our guests at home , we will treat you better . ’ 
 ‘ It seems to me good enough for a birthday - party , ’ said Frodo . 
 Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink , for Pippin mind was filled with the light upon the elf - faces , and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that Pippin felt in a waking dream . But Pippin remembered that there was bread , surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving ; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens ; Pippin drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught , cool as a clear fountain , golden as a summer afternoon . 
 Sam could never describe in words , nor picture clearly to Sam , what Sam felt or thought that night , though picture remained in Sam memory as one of the chief events of Sam life . The nearest Sam ever got was to say : ‘ Well , sir , if I could grow apples like that , I would call myself a gardener . But it was the singing that went to my heart , if you know what I mean . ’ 
 Frodo sat , eating , drinking , and talking with delight ; but Sam mind was chiefly on the words spoken . Sam knew a little of the elf - speech and listened eagerly . Now and again Sam spoke to those that served Sam and thanked those in those own language . those smiled at Sam and said laughing : ‘ Here is a jewel among hobbits ! ’ 
 After a while Pippin fell fast asleep , and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees ; there Pippin was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away . Sam refused to leave Sam master . When Pippin had gone , Sam came and sat curled up at Frodo ’s feet , where at last Sam nodded and closed Sam eyes . Frodo remained long awake , talking with Gildor . 
 feet spoke of many things , old and new , and Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire . The tidings were mostly sad and ominous : of gathering darkness , the wars of Men , and the flight of the Elves . At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to Sam heart : 
 ‘ Tell me , Gildor , have you ever seen Bilbo since Bilbo left us ? ’ 
 Gildor smiled . ‘ Yes , ’ Sam answered . ‘ Twice . Bilbo said farewell to us on this very spot . But I saw Bilbo once again , far from here . ’ Sam would say no more about Bilbo , and Frodo fell silent . 
 ‘ You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself , Frodo , ’ said Gildor . ‘ But I already know a little , and I can read more in your face and in the thought behind your questions . You are leaving the Shire , and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek , or accomplish what you intend , or that you will ever return . Is not that so ? ’ 
 ‘ that is , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam . ’ Frodo looked down at Sam , who was snoring gently . 
 ‘ The secret will not reach the Enemy from us , ’ said Gildor . 
 ‘ The Enemy ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Then you know why I am leaving the Shire ? ’ 
 ‘ I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you , ’ answered Gildor ; ‘ but I perceive that Sam is – strange indeed though that seems to me . And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you , and upon either side . ’ 
 ‘ You mean the Riders ? I feared that Riders were servants of the Enemy . What are the Black Riders ? ’ 
 ‘ Has Gandalf told you nothing ? ’ 
 ‘ Nothing about such creatures . ’ 
 ‘ Then I think it is not for me to say more – lest terror should keep you from your journey . For it seems to me that you have set out only just in time , if indeed you are in time . You must now make haste , and neither stay nor turn back ; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you . ’ 
 ‘ I can not imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints and warnings , ’ exclaimed Frodo . ‘ I knew that danger lay ahead , of course ; but I did not expect to meet that in our own Shire . Ca n’t a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in peace ? ’ 
 ‘ But it is not your own Shire , ’ said Gildor . ‘ Others dwelt here before hobbits were ; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more . The wide world is all about you : you can fence yourselves in , but you can not for ever fence world out . ’ 
 ‘ I know – and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar . What can I do now ? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly , and make my way to Rivendell ; but now my footsteps are dogged , before ever I get to Buckland . ’ 
 ‘ I think you should still follow that plan , ’ said Gildor . ‘ I do not think the Road will prove too hard for your courage . But if you desire clearer counsel , you should ask Gandalf . I do not know the reason for your flight , and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you . These things Gandalf must know . I suppose that you will see counsel before you leave the Shire ? ’ 
 ‘ I hope so . But that is another thing that makes me anxious . I have been expecting Gandalf for many days . Gandalf was to have come to Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago ; but Gandalf has never appeared . Now I am wondering what can have happened . Should I wait for Gandalf ? ’ 
 Gildor was silent for a moment . ‘ I do not like this news , ’ Gandalf said at last . ‘ That Gandalf should be late , does not bode well . But it is said : Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards , for Wizards are subtle and quick to anger . The choice is yours : to go or wait . ’ 
 ‘ And choice is also said , ’ answered Frodo : ‘ Go not to the Elves for counsel , for Elves will say both no and yes . ’ 
 ‘ Is choice indeed ? ’ laughed Gildor . ‘ Elves seldom give unguarded advice , for advice is a dangerous gift , even from the wise to the wise , and all courses may run ill . But what would you ? You have not told me all concerning yourself ; and how then shall I choose better than you ? But if you demand advice , I will for friendship ’s sake give advice . I think you should now go at once , without delay ; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out , then I also advise this : do not go alone . Take such friends as are trusty and willing . Now you should be grateful , for I do not give this counsel gladly . The Elves have Elves own labours and Elves own sorrows , and Elves are little concerned with the ways of hobbits , or of any other creatures upon earth . Our paths cross Elves seldom , by chance or purpose . In this meeting there may be more than chance ; but the purpose is not clear to me , and I fear to say too much . ’ 
 ‘ I am deeply grateful , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ but I wish you would tell me plainly what the Black Riders are . If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while , and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me . ’ 
 ‘ Is it not enough to know that Riders are servants of the Enemy ? ’ answered Gildor . ‘ Flee Riders ! Speak no words to Riders ! Riders are deadly . Ask no more of me ! But my heart forbodes that , ere all is ended , you , Frodo son of Drogo , will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion . May Elbereth protect you ! ’ 
 ‘ But where shall I find courage ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ That is what I chiefly need . ’ 
 ‘ Courage is found in unlikely places , ’ said Gildor . ‘ Be of good hope ! Sleep now ! In the morning we shall have gone ; but we will send our messages through the lands . The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey , and those that have power for good shall be on the watch . I name you Elf - friend ; and may the stars shine upon the end of your road ! Seldom have we had such delight in strangers , and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world . ’ 
 Frodo felt sleep coming upon Gildor , even as Gildor finished speaking . ‘ I will sleep now , ’ Frodo said ; and the Elf led Speech to a bower beside Pippin , and Pippin threw Pippin upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber . 
 Chapter 4 
 A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS 
 In the morning Frodo woke refreshed . Pippin was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground ; Pippin bed was of fern and grass , deep and soft and strangely fragrant . The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves , which were still green upon the tree . Pippin jumped up and went out . 
 Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood . Pippin was standing studying the sky and weather . There was no sign of the Elves . 
 ‘ Elves have left us fruit and drink , and bread , ’ said Pippin . ‘ Come and have your breakfast . The bread tastes almost as good as bread did last night . I did not want to leave you any , but Sam insisted . ’ 
 Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat . ‘ What is the plan for today ? ’ asked Pippin . 
 ‘ To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible , ’ answered Frodo , and gave Pippin attention to the food . 
 ‘ Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders ? ’ asked Pippin cheerfully . Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of sun did not seem very alarming to Pippin . 
 ‘ Yes , probably , ’ said Frodo , not liking the reminder . ‘ But I hope to get across the river without Riders seeing us . ’ 
 ‘ Did you find out anything about Riders from Gildor ? ’ 
 ‘ Not much – only hints and riddles , ’ said Frodo evasively . 
 ‘ Did you ask about the sniffing ? ’ 
 ‘ We did n’t discuss sniffing , ’ said Frodo with Frodo mouth full . 
 ‘ You should have . I am sure sniffing is very important . ’ 
 ‘ In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain sniffing , ’ said Frodo sharply . ‘ And now leave me in peace for a bit ! I do n’t want to answer a string of questions while I am eating . I want to think ! ’ 
 ‘ Good heavens ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ At breakfast ? ’ Pippin walked away towards the edge of the green . 
 From Frodo ’s mind the bright morning – treacherously bright , Pippin thought – had not banished the fear of pursuit ; and Pippin pondered the words of Gildor . The merry voice of Pippin came to Gildor . Gildor was running on the green turf and singing . 
 ‘ No ! I could not ! ’ voice said to voice . ‘ It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the Shire with me , until we are hungry and weary , and food and bed are sweet . To take friends into exile , where hunger and weariness may have no cure , is quite another – even if friends are willing to come . The inheritance is mine alone . I do n’t think I ought even to take Sam . ’ Sam looked at Sam Gamgee , and discovered that Sam was watching Gamgee . 
 ‘ Well , Sam ! ’ Gamgee said . ‘ What about Well ? I am leaving the Shire as soon as ever I can – in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at Crickhollow , if Crickhollow can be helped . ’ 
 ‘ Very good , sir ! ’ 
 ‘ You still mean to come with me ? ’ 
 ‘ I do . ’ 
 ‘ Crickhollow is going to be very dangerous , Sam . Crickhollow is already dangerous . Most likely neither of us will come back . ’ 
 ‘ If you do n’t come back , sir , then I sha n’t , that ’s certain , ’ said Sam . ‘ Do n’t you leave Sam ! neither said to me . Leave Sam ! I said . I never mean to . I am going with Sam , if Sam climbs to the Moon ; and if any of those Black Riders try to stop Sam , Riders ’ll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with , I said . Riders laughed . ’ 
 ‘ Who are Riders , and what are you talking about ? ’ 
 ‘ The Elves , sir . We had some talk last night ; and Riders seemed to know you were going away , so I did n’t see the use of denying use . Wonderful folk , Elves , sir ! Wonderful ! ’ 
 ‘ Elves are , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Do you like Elves still , now you have had a closer view ? ’ 
 ‘ Elves seem a bit above my likes and dislikes , so to speak , ’ answered Sam slowly . ‘ It do n’t seem to matter what I think about Elves . Elves are quite different from what I expected – so old and young , and so gay and sad , as view were . ’ 
 Frodo looked at Sam rather startled , half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over Sam . Frodo did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that Sam thought Sam knew . But Frodo looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there , except that Gamgee face was unusually thoughtful . 
 ‘ Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now – now that your wish to see Elves has come true already ? ’ Gamgee asked . 
 ‘ Yes , sir . I do n’t know how to say Shire , but after last night I feel different . I seem to see ahead , in a kind of way . I know we are going to take a very long road , into darkness ; but I know I ca n’t turn back . It is n’t to see Elves now , nor dragons , nor mountains , that I want – I do n’t rightly know what I want : but I have something to do before the end , and something lies ahead , not in the Shire . I must see something through , sir , if you understand me . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t altogether . But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion . I am content . We will go together . ’ 
 Frodo finished Frodo breakfast in silence . Then standing up Gandalf looked over the land ahead , and called to Pippin . 
 ‘ All ready to start ? ’ Gandalf said as Pippin ran up . ‘ We must be getting off at once . We slept late ; and there are a good many miles to go . ’ 
 ‘ You slept late , you mean , ’ said Pippin . ‘ I was up long before ; and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking . ’ 
 ‘ I have finished both now . And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible . I am not going out of the way , back to the road we left last night : I am going to cut straight across country from here . ’ 
 ‘ Then you are going to fly , ’ said Pippin . ‘ You wo n’t cut straight on foot anywhere in this country . ’ 
 ‘ We can cut straighter than the road anyway , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ The Ferry is east from Woodhall ; but the hard road curves away to the left – you can see a bend of Woodhall away north over there . Woodhall goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock . But that is miles out of the way . We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand . ’ 
 ‘ Short cuts make long delays , ’ argued Pippin . ‘ The country is rough round here , and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish – I know the land in these parts . And if you are worrying about Black Riders , I ca n’t see that land is any worse meeting Riders on a road than in a wood or a field . ’ 
 ‘ It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ And if you are supposed to be on the road , there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off chance . ’ 
 ‘ All right ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ I will follow you into every bog and ditch . But bog is hard ! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stock before sundown . The best beer in the Eastfarthing , or used to be : it is a long time since I tasted Eastfarthing . ’ 
 ‘ That settles Eastfarthing ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ Short cuts make delays , but inns make longer ones . At all costs we must keep you away from the Golden Perch . We want to get to Bucklebury before dark . What do you say , Sam ? ’ 
 ‘ I will go along with you , Mr. Frodo , ’ said Sam ( in spite of private misgivings and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing ) . 
 ‘ Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar , let ’s go now ! ’ said Pippin . 
 spite was already nearly as hot as spite had been the day before ; but clouds were beginning to come up from the West . It looked likely to turn to rain . The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below . hobbits course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to hobbits left , and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills , until hobbits reached the flats beyond . Then hobbits could make straight for the Ferry over country that was open , except for a few ditches and fences . Frodo reckoned hobbits had eighteen miles to go in a straight line . 
 Ferry soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than thicket had appeared . There were no paths in the undergrowth , and paths did not get on very fast . When paths had struggled to the bottom of the bank , paths found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles . Most inconveniently stream cut across the line paths had chosen . paths could not jump over stream , nor indeed get across stream at all without getting wet , scratched , and muddy . paths halted , wondering what to do . ‘ First check ! ’ said Pippin , smiling grimly . 
 Sam Gamgee looked back . Through an opening in the trees Gamgee caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which trees had climbed down . 
 ‘ Look ! ’ Gamgee said , clutching Frodo by the arm . trees all looked , and on the edge high above trees trees saw against the sky a horse standing . Beside horse stooped a black figure . 
 trees at once gave up any idea of going back . Frodo led the way , and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream . ‘ Whew ! ’ Gamgee said to Pippin . ‘ We were both right ! The short cut has gone crooked already ; but we got under cover only just in time . You ’ve got sharp ears , Sam : can you hear anything coming ? ’ 
 trees stood still , almost holding trees breath as trees listened ; but there was no sound of pursuit . ‘ I do n’t fancy Gamgee would try bringing Gamgee horse down that bank , ’ said Sam . ‘ But I guess Gamgee knows we came down bank . We had better be going on . ’ 
 Going on was not altogether easy . trees had packs to carry , and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let trees through . trees were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind , and the air was still and stuffy . When trees forced trees way at last into more open ground , trees were hot and tired and very scratched , and trees were also no longer certain of the direction in which trees were going . The banks of the stream sank , as stream reached the levels and became broader and shallower , wandering off towards the Marish and the River . 
 ‘ Why , this is the Stock - brook ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ If we are going to try and get back on to our course , we must cross at once and bear right . ’ 
 banks waded the stream , and hurried over a wide open space , rush - grown and treeless , on the further side . Beyond that banks came again to a belt of trees : tall oaks , for the most part , with here and there an elm tree or an ash . The ground was fairly level , and there was little undergrowth ; but the trees were too close for trees to see far ahead . The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind , and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky . Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down . leaves trudged along as fast as leaves could , over patches of grass , and through thick drifts of old leaves ; and all about spots the rain pattered and trickled . spots did not talk , but kept glancing back , and from side to side . 
 After half an hour Pippin said : ‘ I hope we have not turned too much towards the south , and are not walking longwise through this wood ! longwise is not a very broad belt – I should have said no more than a mile at the widest – and we ought to have been through longwise by now . ’ 
 ‘ It is no good our starting to go in zig - zags , ’ said Frodo . ‘ That wo n’t mend matters . Let us keep on as we are going ! I am not sure that I want to come out into the open yet . ’ 
 matters went on for perhaps another couple of miles . Then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened . It was now past mid - day , and matters felt - was high time for lunch . matters halted under an elm tree : tree leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick , and the ground at tree feet was fairly dry and sheltered . When matters came to make matters meal , matters found that the Elves had filled matters bottles with a clear drink , pale golden in colour : meal had the scent of a honey made of many flowers , and was wonderfully refreshing . Very soon matters were laughing , and snapping matters fingers at rain , and at Black Riders . The last few miles , matters felt , would soon be behind matters . 
 Frodo propped Frodo back against the tree - trunk , and closed back eyes . Sam and Pippin sat near , and Sam began to hum , and then to sing softly : 
 Ho ! Ho ! Ho ! to the bottle I go 
 To heal my heart and drown my woe . 
 Rain may fall and wind may blow , 
 And many miles be still to go , 
 But under a tall tree I will lie , 
 And let the clouds go sailing by . 
 Ho ! Ho ! Ho ! miles began again louder . miles stopped short suddenly . Frodo sprang to Frodo feet . A long - drawn wail came down the wind , like the cry of some evil and lonely creature . wail rose and fell , and ended on a high piercing note . Even as miles sat and stood , as if suddenly frozen , it was answered by another cry , fainter and further off , but no less chilling to the blood . There was then a silence , broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves . 
 ‘ And what do you think that was ? ’ Pippin asked at last , trying to speak lightly , but quavering a little . ‘ If that was a bird , it was one that I never heard in the Shire before . ’ 
 ‘ that was not bird or beast , ’ said Frodo . ‘ that was a call , or a signal – there were words in that cry , though I could not catch words . But no hobbit has such a voice . ’ 
 No more was said about hobbit . words were all thinking of the Riders , but no one spoke of words . words were now reluctant either to stay or go on ; but sooner or later words had got to get across the open country to the Ferry , and it was best to go sooner and in daylight . In a few moments words had shouldered words packs again and were off . 
 Before long the wood came to a sudden end . Wide grasslands stretched before words . words now saw that words had , in fact , turned too much to the south . Away over the flats words could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury across the River , but Bucklebury was now to words left . Creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees , words set off across the open as quickly as words could . 
 At first words felt afraid , away from the shelter of the wood . Far back behind words stood the high place where words had breakfasted . Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky ; but there was no sign of one . The sun escaping from the breaking clouds , as sun sank towards the hills hills had left , was now shining brightly again . hills fear left hills , though hills still felt uneasy . But the land became steadily more tame and well - ordered . Soon hills came into well - tended fields and meadows : there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage . Everything seemed quiet and peaceful , just an ordinary corner of the Shire . hills spirits rose with every step . The line of the River grew nearer ; and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind . 
 Riders passed along the edge of a huge turnip - field , and came to a stout gate . Beyond gate a rutted lane ran between low well - laid hedges towards a distant clump of trees . Pippin stopped . 
 ‘ I know these fields and this gate ! ’ Pippin said . ‘ This is Bamfurlong , old Farmer Maggot ’s land . That ’s Maggot farm away there in the trees . ’ 
 ‘ One trouble after another ! ’ said Frodo , looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon ’s den . The others looked at Pippin in surprise . 
 ‘ What ’s wrong with old Maggot ? ’ asked Pippin . ‘ Pippin ’s a good friend to all the Brandybucks . Of course Pippin ’s a terror to trespassers , and keeps ferocious dogs – but after all , folk down here are near the border and have to be more on trespassers guard . ’ 
 ‘ I know , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But all the same , ’ Frodo added with a shamefaced laugh , ‘ I am terrified of Pippin and Pippin dogs . I have avoided Pippin farm for years and years . Pippin caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms , when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall . On the last occasion Pippin beat me , and then took me and showed me to Pippin dogs . “ See , lads , ” Pippin said , “ next time this young varmint sets foot on my land , you can eat varmint . Now see varmint off ! ” dogs chased me all the way to the Ferry . I have never got over the fright – though I daresay the beasts knew beasts business and would not really have touched me . ’ 
 Pippin laughed . ‘ Well , business ’s time you made business up . Especially if you are coming back to live in Buckland . Old Maggot is really a stout fellow – if you leave Ferry mushrooms alone . Let ’s get into the lane and then we sha n’t be trespassing . If we meet Ferry , I ’ll do the talking . Ferry is a friend of Merry ’s , and I used to come here with Ferry a good deal at one time . ’ 
 friend went along the lane , until friend saw the thatched roofs of a large house and farm - buildings peeping out among the trees ahead . The Maggots , and the Puddifoots of Stock , and most of the inhabitants of the Marish , were house - dwellers ; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round wall . There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane . 
 Suddenly as dwellers drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out , and a loud voice was heard shouting : ‘ Grip ! Fang ! Wolf ! Come on , lads ! ’ 
 Frodo and Sam stopped dead , but Pippin walked on a few paces . The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane , and dashed towards the travellers , barking fiercely . dogs took no notice of Pippin ; but Sam shrank against the wall , while two wolvish - looking dogs sniffed at Sam suspiciously , and snarled if Sam moved . The largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo , bristling and growling . 
 Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick - set hobbit with a round red face . ‘ Hallo ! Hallo ! And who may you be , and what may you be wanting ? ’ Sam asked . 
 ‘ Good afternoon , Mr. Maggot ! ’ said Pippin . 
 The farmer looked at Sam closely . ‘ Well , if afternoon is n’t Master Pippin – Mr. Peregrin Took , I should say ! ’ Sam cried , changing from a scowl to a grin . ‘ afternoon ’s a long time since I saw you round here . afternoon ’s lucky for you that I know you . I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers . There are some funny things going on today . Of course , we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times . Too near the River , ’ he said , shaking he head . ‘ But this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on . River wo n’t cross my land without leave a second time , not if I can stop fellow . ’ 
 ‘ What fellow do you mean ? ’ asked Pippin . 
 ‘ Then you have n’t seen River ? ’ said the farmer . ‘ River went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back . River was a funny customer and asking funny questions . But perhaps you ’ll come along inside , and we ’ll pass the news more comfortable . I ’ve a drop of good ale on tap , if you and your friends are willing , Mr. Took . ’ 
 It seemed plain that the farmer would tell Took more , if allowed to do invitation in farmer own time and fashion , so time all accepted the invitation . ‘ What about the dogs ? ’ asked Frodo anxiously . 
 The farmer laughed . ‘ dogs wo n’t harm you – not unless I tell ’em to . Here , Grip ! Fang ! Heel ! ’ Fang cried . ‘ Heel , Wolf ! ’ To the relief of Frodo and Sam , the dogs walked away and let dogs go free . 
 Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer . ‘ Mr. Frodo Baggins , ’ Sam said . ‘ You may not remember Baggins , but Baggins used to live at Brandy Hall . ’ At the name Baggins the farmer started , and gave Frodo a sharp glance . For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused , and that the dogs would be told to see Frodo off . But Farmer Maggot took Frodo by the arm . 
 ‘ Well , if that is n’t queerer than ever ! ’ Frodo exclaimed . ‘ Mr. Baggins is that ? Come inside ! We must have a talk . ’ 
 Baggins went into the farmer ’s kitchen , and sat by the wide fire - place . Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug , and filled four large mugs . beer was a good brew , and Pippin found Pippin more than compensated for missing the Golden Perch . Sam sipped Sam beer suspiciously . Sam had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire ; and also Sam was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten Sam master , however long ago . 
 After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects ( which were no worse than usual ) , Farmer Maggot put down Maggot mug and looked at remarks all in turn . 
 ‘ Now , Mr. Peregrin , ’ Maggot said , ‘ where might you be coming from , and where might you be going to ? Were you coming to visit me ? For , if so , you had gone past my gate without my seeing you . ’ 
 ‘ Well , no , ’ answered Pippin . ‘ To tell you the truth , since you have guessed truth , we got into the lane from the other end : we had come over your fields . But that was quite by accident . We lost our way in the woods , back near Woodhall , trying to take a short cut to the Ferry . ’ 
 ‘ If you were in a hurry , the road would have served you better , ’ said the farmer . ‘ But I was n’t worrying about that . You have leave to walk over my land , if you have a mind , Mr. Peregrin . And you , Mr. Baggins – though I daresay you still like mushrooms . ’ Baggins laughed . ‘ Ah yes , I recognized the name . I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst young rascals of Buckland . But it was n’t mushrooms I was thinking of . I had just heard the name Baggins before you turned up . What do you think that funny customer asked me ? ’ 
 customer waited anxiously for Baggins to go on . ‘ Well , ’ the farmer continued , approaching Baggins point with slow relish , ‘ Baggins came riding on a big black horse in at the gate , which happened to be open , and right up to my door . All black Baggins was Baggins , too , and cloaked and hooded up , as if Baggins did not want to be known . “ Now what in the Shire can Baggins want ? ” I thought to myself . We do n’t see many of the Big Folk over the border ; and anyway I had never heard of any like this black fellow . 
 ‘ “ Good - day to you ! ” I says , going out to Baggins . “ This lane do n’t lead anywhere , and wherever you may be going , your quickest way will be back to the road . ” I did n’t like the looks of Baggins ; and when Grip came out , Baggins took one sniff and let out a yelp as if Baggins had been stung : Baggins put down Baggins tail and bolted off howling . The black fellow sat quite still . 
 ‘ “ I come from yonder , ” Baggins said , slow and stiff - like , pointing back west , over my fields , if you please . “ Have you seen Baggins ? ” Baggins asked in a queer voice , and bent down towards me . I could not see any face , for Baggins hood fell down so low ; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back . But I did not see why Baggins should come riding over my land so bold . 
 ‘ “ Be off ! ” I said . “ There are no Bagginses here . You ’re in the wrong part of the Shire . You had better go back west to Hobbiton – but you can go by road this time . ” 
 ‘ “ Baggins has left , ” Baggins answered in a whisper . “ Baggins is coming . Baggins is not far away . I wish to find Baggins . If Baggins passes will you tell me ? I will come back with gold . ” 
 ‘ “ No you wo n’t , ” I said . “ You ’ll go back where you belong , double quick . I give you one minute before I call all my dogs . ” 
 ‘ Baggins gave a sort of hiss . hiss might have been laughing , and hiss might not . Then Baggins spurred Baggins great horse right at me , and I jumped out of the way only just in time . I called the dogs , but Baggins swung off , and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder . What do you think of that ? ’ 
 Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire , but Frodo only thought was how on earth would dogs reach the Ferry . ‘ I do n’t know what to think , ’ Ferry said at last . 
 ‘ Then I ’ll tell you what to think , ’ said Maggot . ‘ You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk , Mr. Frodo . Folk are queer up there . ’ Sam stirred in Sam chair , and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye . ‘ But you were always a reckless lad . When I heard you had left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo , I said that you were going to find trouble . Mark my words , this all comes of those strange doings of Mr. Bilbo ’s . Bilbo money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts , parts say . Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that Bilbo buried in the hill of Hobbiton , as I hear ? ’ 
 Frodo said nothing : the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting . 
 ‘ Well , Mr. Frodo , ’ Maggot went on , ‘ I ’m glad that you ’ve had the sense to come back to Buckland . My advice is : stay there ! And do n’t get mixed up with these outlandish folk . You ’ll have friends in these parts . If any of these black fellows come after you again , I ’ll deal with fellows . I ’ll say you ’re dead , or have left the Shire , or anything you like . And that might be true enough ; for as like as not that is old Mr. Bilbo fellows want news of . ’ 
 ‘ Maybe you ’re right , ’ said Frodo , avoiding the farmer ’s eye and staring at the fire . 
 Maggot looked at Frodo thoughtfully . ‘ Well , I see you have ideas of your own , ’ Frodo said . ‘ that is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon ; and maybe my news was no great news to you , after all . I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to yourself ; but I see you are in some kind of trouble . Perhaps you are thinking mind wo n’t be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught ? ’ 
 ‘ I was thinking so , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But we have got to try and get there ; and mind wo n’t be done by sitting and thinking . So I am afraid we must be going . Thank you very much indeed for your kindness ! I ’ve been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years , Farmer Maggot , though you may laugh to hear terror . terror ’s a pity : for I ’ve missed a good friend . And now I ’m sorry to leave so soon . But I ’ll come back , perhaps , one day – if I get a chance . ’ 
 ‘ You ’ll be welcome when you come , ’ said Maggot . ‘ But now I ’ve a notion . notion ’s near sundown already , and we are going to have our supper ; for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun . If you and Mr. Peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us , we would be pleased ! ’ 
 ‘ And so should we ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ But we must be going at once , I ’m afraid . Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry . ’ 
 ‘ Ah ! but wait a minute ! I was going to say : after a bit of supper , I ’ll get out a small waggon , and I ’ll drive you all to the Ferry . That will save you a good step , and That might also save you trouble of another sort . ’ 
 Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully , to the relief of Pippin and Sam . The sun was already behind the western hills , and the light was failing . Two of Maggot ’s sons and Sam three daughters came in , and a generous supper was laid on the large table . The kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended . Mrs. Maggot bustled in and out . One or two other hobbits belonging to the farm - household came in . In a short while fourteen sat down to eat . There was beer in plenty , and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon , besides much other solid farmhouse fare . The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones . 
 When farmer had finished , the farmer and farmer sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon ready . It was dark in the yard , when the guests came out . guests threw guests packs on board and climbed in . The farmer sat in the driving - seat , and whipped up farmer two stout ponies . farmer wife stood in the light of the open door . 
 ‘ You be careful of yourself , Maggot ! ’ wife called . ‘ Do n’t go arguing with any foreigners , and come straight back ! ’ 
 ‘ I will ! ’ said light , and drove out of the gate . There was now no breath of wind stirring ; the night was still and quiet , and a chill was in the air . foreigners went without lights and took chill slowly . After a mile or two the lane came to an end , crossing a deep dike , and climbing a short slope up on to the high - banked causeway . 
 Maggot got down and took a good look either way , north and south , but nothing could be seen in the darkness , and there was not a sound in the still air . Thin strands of river - mist were hanging above the dikes , and crawling over the fields . 
 ‘ mist ’s going to be thick , ’ said Maggot ; ‘ but I ’ll not light my lanterns till I turn for home . We ’ll hear anything on the road long before we meet road tonight . ’ 
 mist was five miles or more from Maggot ’s lane to the Ferry . The hobbits wrapped hobbits up , but hobbits ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies ’ hoofs . The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo . Beside snail Pippin was nodding towards sleep ; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog . 
 hobbits reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last . entrance was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on posts right . Farmer Maggot drew in Maggot ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt . posts were just beginning to scramble out , when suddenly posts heard what posts had all been dreading : hoofs on the road ahead . The sound was coming towards posts . 
 Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies ’ heads , and peering forward into the gloom . Clip - clop , clip - clop came the approaching rider . The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still , foggy air . 
 ‘ You ’d better be hidden , Mr. Frodo , ’ said Sam anxiously . ‘ You get down in the waggon and cover up with blankets , and we ’ll send this rider to the rightabouts ! ’ Sam climbed out and went to the farmer ’s side . Black Riders would have to ride over Sam to get near the waggon . 
 Clop - clop , clop - clop . The rider was nearly on Riders . 
 ‘ Hallo there ! ’ called Farmer Maggot . The advancing hoofs stopped short . hoofs thought hoofs could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist , a yard or two ahead . 
 ‘ Now then ! ’ said the farmer , throwing the reins to Sam and striding forward . ‘ Do n’t you come a step nearer ! What do you want , and where are you going ? ’ 
 ‘ I want Mr. Baggins . Have you seen Baggins ? ’ said a muffled voice – but the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck . A dark lantern was uncovered , and lantern light fell on the astonished face of the farmer . 
 ‘ Mr. Merry ! ’ Brandybuck cried . 
 ‘ Yes , of course ! Who did you think course was ? ’ said Merry coming forward . As Brandybuck came out of the mist and farmer fears subsided , Brandybuck seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit - size . Brandybuck was riding a pony , and a scarf was swathed round Brandybuck neck and over Brandybuck chin to keep out the fog . 
 Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet Brandybuck . ‘ So there you are at last ! ’ said Merry . ‘ I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all today , and I was just going back to supper . When supper grew foggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches . But I ’m blest if I know which way you have come . Where did you find ditches , Mr. Maggot ? In your duck - pond ? ’ 
 ‘ No , I caught ’em trespassing , ’ said the farmer , ‘ and nearly set my dogs on ’em ; but dogs ’ll tell you all the story , I ’ve no doubt . Now , if you ’ll excuse me , Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all , I ’d best be turning for home . Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick . ’ 
 Maggot backed the waggon into the lane and turned waggon . ‘ Well , good night to you all , ’ Frodo said . ‘ night ’s been a queer day , and no mistake . But all ’s well as ends well ; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors . I ’ll not deny that I ’ll be glad now when I do . ’ Frodo lit Frodo lanterns , and got up . Suddenly Frodo produced a large basket from under the seat . ‘ I was nearly forgetting , ’ Frodo said . ‘ Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins , with Maggot compliments . ’ Frodo handed basket down and moved off , followed by a chorus of thanks and good - nights . 
 thanks watched the pale rings of light round Frodo lanterns as thanks dwindled into the foggy night . Suddenly Frodo laughed : from the covered basket Frodo held , the scent of mushrooms was rising . 
 Chapter 5 
 A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED 
 ‘ Now we had better get home ourselves , ’ said Merry . ‘ There ’s something funny about all this , I see ; but this must wait till we get in . ’ 
 thanks turned down the Ferry lane , which was straight and well - kept and edged with large white - washed stones . In a hundred yards or so a brought thanks to the river - bank , where there was a broad wooden landing - stage . A large flat ferry - boat was moored beside a . The white bollards near the water ’s edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts . Behind bollards the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges ; but the water before bollards was dark , with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank . There seemed to be less fog on the further side . 
 Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry , and the others followed . Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole . The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before others . On the other side the bank was steep , and up bank a winding path climbed from the further landing . Lamps were twinkling there . Behind loomed up the Buck Hill ; and out of Hill , through stray shrouds of mist , shone many round windows , yellow and red . windows were the windows of Brandy Hall , the ancient home of the Brandybucks . 
 Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck , head of the Oldbuck family , one of the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire , had crossed the river , which was the original boundary of the land eastwards . Oldbuck built ( and excavated ) Brandy Hall , changed Oldbuck name to Brandybuck , and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent country . Oldbuck family grew and grew , and after Oldbuck days continued to grow , until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low hill , and had three large front - doors , many side - doors , and about a hundred windows . The Brandybucks and Brandybucks numerous dependants then began to burrow , and later to build , all round about . That was the origin of Buckland , a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest , a sort of colony from the Shire . That chief village was Bucklebury , clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall . 
 The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders , and the authority of the Master of the Hall ( as the head of the Brandybuck family was called ) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey . But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar , half foreigners as folk were . Though , as a matter of fact , Bucklanders were not very different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings . Except in one point : Bucklanders were fond of boats , and some of Bucklanders could swim . 
 Bucklanders land was originally unprotected from the East ; but on that side Bucklanders had built a hedge : the High Hay . land had been planted many generations ago , and was now thick and tall , for land was constantly tended . land ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge , in a big loop curving away from the river , to Haysend ( where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine ): well over twenty miles from end to end . But , of course , Withywindle was not a complete protection . The Forest drew close to the hedge in many places . The Bucklanders kept Bucklanders doors locked after dark , and that also was not usual in the Shire . 
 The ferry - boat moved slowly across the water . The Buckland shore drew nearer . Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before . Sam had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by : Sam old life lay behind in the mists , dark adventure lay in front . Sam scratched Sam head , and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag End . 
 The four hobbits stepped off the ferry . Merry was tying ferry up , and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path , when Sam ( who had been looking back , as if to take farewell of the Shire ) said in a hoarse whisper : 
 ‘ Look back , Mr. Frodo ! Do you see anything ? ’ 
 On the far stage , under the distant lamps , hobbits could just make out a figure : stage looked like a dark black bundle left behind . But as hobbits looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that , as if searching the ground . stage then crawled , or went crouching , back into the gloom beyond the lamps . 
 ‘ What in the Shire is that ? ’ exclaimed Merry . 
 ‘ Something that is following us , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But do n’t ask any more now ! Let ’s get away at once ! ’ lamps hurried up the path to the top of the bank , but when lamps looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist , and nothing could be seen . 
 ‘ Thank goodness you do n’t keep any boats on the west - bank ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ Can horses cross the river ? ’ 
 ‘ horses can go ten miles north to Brandywine Bridge – or horses might swim , ’ answered Merry . ‘ Though I never heard of any horse swimming the Brandywine . But what have horses to do with Brandywine ? ’ 
 ‘ I ’ll tell you later . Let ’s get indoors and then we can talk . ’ 
 ‘ All right ! You and Pippin know your way ; so I ’ll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming . We ’ll see about supper and things . ’ 
 ‘ We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ but we could do with another . ’ 
 ‘ You shall have another ! Give me that basket ! ’ said Merry , and rode ahead into the darkness . 
 darkness was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo ’s new house at Crickhollow . Frodo passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on Hill left , and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from the Bridge . Half a mile northward along this Hill came to a lane opening on Hill right . This Hill followed for a couple of miles as This climbed up and down into the country . 
 At last Hill came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge . Nothing could be seen of the house in the dark : house stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge . Frodo had chosen house , because house stood in an out - of - the - way corner of the country , and there were no other dwellings close by . You could get in and out without being noticed . house had been built a long while before by the Brandybucks , for the use of guests , or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time . house was an old - fashioned countrified house , as much like a hobbit - hole as possible : it was long and low , with no upper storey ; and house had a roof of turf , round windows , and a large round door . 
 As windows walked up the green path from the gate no light was visible ; the windows were dark and shuttered . Frodo knocked on the door , and Fatty Bolger opened door . A friendly light streamed out . light slipped in quickly and shut light and the light inside . light were in a wide hall with doors on either side ; in front of light a passage ran back down the middle of the house . 
 ‘ Well , what do you think of house ? ’ asked Merry coming up the passage . ‘ We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home . After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cart - load yesterday . ’ 
 Frodo looked round . Frodo did look like home . Many of Merry own favourite things – or Bilbo ’s things ( things reminded Merry sharply of Merry in things new setting ) – were arranged as nearly as possible as things had been at Bag End . It was a pleasant , comfortable , welcoming place ; and Merry found Merry wishing that Merry was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement . It seemed unfair to have put Merry friends to all this trouble ; and Merry wondered again how Merry was going to break the news to friends that Merry must leave friends so soon , indeed at once . Yet that would have to be done that very night , before friends all went to bed . 
 ‘ that ’s delightful ! ’ Merry said with an effort . ‘ I hardly feel that I have moved at all . ’ 
 The travellers hung up travellers cloaks , and piled travellers packs on the floor . Merry led travellers down the passage and threw open a door at the far end . Firelight came out , and a puff of steam . 
 ‘ A bath ! ’ cried Pippin . ‘ O blessed Meriadoc ! ’ 
 ‘ Which order shall we go in ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Eldest first , or quickest first ? You ’ll be last either way , Master Peregrin . ’ 
 ‘ Trust me to arrange things better than that ! ’ said Merry . ‘ We ca n’t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths . In that room there are three tubs , and a copper full of boiling water . There are also towels , mats and soap . Get inside , and be quick ! ’ 
 Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage , and busied Merry with the final preparations for a late supper . Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing . The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo ’s favourite bath - songs . 
 Sing hey ! for the bath at close of day 
 that washes the weary mud away ! 
 A loon is Bilbo that will not sing : 
 O ! Water Hot is a noble thing ! 
 O ! Sweet is the sound of falling rain , 
 and the brook that leaps from hill to plain ; 
 but better than rain or rippling streams 
 is Water Hot that smokes and steams . 
 O ! Water cold we may pour at need 
 down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed ; 
 but better is Beer , if drink we lack , 
 and Water Hot poured down the back . 
 O ! Water is fair that leaps on high 
 in a fountain white beneath the sky ; 
 but never did fountain sound so sweet 
 as splashing Hot Water with my feet ! 
 There was a terrific splash , and a shout of Whoa ! from Frodo . Whoa appeared that a lot of Pippin ’s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high . 
 Merry went to the door : ‘ What about supper and beer in the throat ? ’ Pippin called . Frodo came out drying Pippin hair . 
 ‘ There ’s so much water in the air that I ’m coming into the kitchen to finish , ’ Pippin said . 
 ‘ Lawks ! ’ said Merry , looking in . The stone floor was swimming . ‘ You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat , Peregrin , ’ Pippin said . ‘ Hurry up , or we sha n’t wait for you . ’ 
 Lawks had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire . ‘ I suppose you three wo n’t want mushrooms again ? ’ said Fredegar without much hope . 
 ‘ Yes we shall ! ’ cried Pippin . 
 ‘ mushrooms ’re mine ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ Given to me by Mrs. Maggot , a queen among farmers ’ wives . Take your greedy hands away , and I ’ll serve hands . ’ 
 Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms , surpassing even the greediest likings of Big People . A fact which partly explains young Frodo ’s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish , and the wrath of the injured Maggot . On this occasion there was plenty for all , even according to hobbit standards . There were also many other things to follow , and when things had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content . things pushed back the table , and drew chairs round the fire . 
 ‘ We ’ll clear up later , ’ said Merry . ‘ Now tell me all about all ! I guess that you have been having adventures , which was not quite fair without me . I want a full account ; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot , and why Maggot spoke to me like that . Merry sounded almost as if Pippin was scared , if that is possible . ’ 
 ‘ We have all been scared , ’ said Pippin after a pause , in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak . ‘ You would have been , too , if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders . ’ 
 ‘ And what are Riders ? ’ 
 ‘ Black figures riding on black horses , ’ answered Pippin . ‘ If Frodo wo n’t talk , I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning . ’ Pippin then gave a full account of Riders journey from the time when Riders left Hobbiton . Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations . Frodo remained silent . 
 ‘ I should think you were making it all up , ’ said Merry , ‘ if I had not seen that black shape on the landing - stage – and heard the queer sound in Maggot ’s voice . What do you make of Maggot all , Frodo ? ’ 
 ‘ Cousin Frodo has been very close , ’ said Pippin . ‘ But the time has come for Frodo to open out . So far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggot ’s guess that That has something to do with old Bilbo ’s treasure . ’ 
 ‘ That was only a guess , ’ said Frodo hastily . ‘ Maggot does not know anything . ’ 
 ‘ Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow , ’ said Merry . ‘ A lot goes on behind Maggot round face that does not come out in Maggot talk . I ’ve heard that Maggot used to go into the Old Forest at one time , and Maggot has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things . But you can at least tell us , Frodo , whether you think Maggot guess good or bad . ’ 
 ‘ I think , ’ answered Frodo slowly , ‘ that reputation was a good guess , as far as reputation goes . There is a connexion with Bilbo ’s old adventures , and the Riders are looking , or perhaps one ought to say searching , for Bilbo or for me . I also fear , if you want to know , that it is no joke at all ; and that I am not safe here or anywhere else . ’ Frodo looked round at the windows and walls , as if Frodo was afraid windows would suddenly give way . The others looked at Frodo in silence , and exchanged meaning glances among others . 
 ‘ joke ’s coming out in a minute , ’ whispered Pippin to Merry . Merry nodded . 
 ‘ Well ! ’ said Frodo at last , sitting up and straightening Frodo back , as if Frodo had made a decision . ‘ I ca n’t keep Well dark any longer . I have got something to tell you all . But I do n’t know quite how to begin . ’ 
 ‘ I think I could help you , ’ said Merry quietly , ‘ by telling you some of Well myself . ’ 
 ‘ What do you mean ? ’ said Frodo , looking at Merry anxiously . 
 ‘ Just this , my dear old Frodo : you are miserable , because you do n’t know how to say good - bye . You meant to leave the Shire , of course . But danger has come on you sooner than you expected , and now you are making up your mind to go at once . And you do n’t want to . We are very sorry for you . ’ 
 Frodo opened Frodo mouth and shut mouth again . mind look of surprise was so comical that Shire laughed . ‘ Dear old Frodo ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes ? You have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that ! You have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April . We have constantly heard you muttering : “ Shall I ever look down into that valley again , I wonder ” , and things like that . And pretending that you had come to the end of your money , and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those Sackville - Bagginses ! And all those close talks with Gandalf . ’ 
 ‘ Good heavens ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I thought I had been both careful and clever . I do n’t know what Gandalf would say . Is all the Shire discussing my departure then ? ’ 
 ‘ Oh no ! ’ said Merry . ‘ Do n’t worry about that ! The secret wo n’t keep for long , of course ; but at present secret is , I think , only known to us conspirators . After all , you must remember that we know you well , and are often with you . We can usually guess what you are thinking . I knew Bilbo , too . To tell you the truth , I have been watching you rather closely ever since Bilbo left . I thought you would go after Bilbo sooner or later ; indeed I expected you to go sooner , and lately we have been very anxious . We have been terrified that you might give us the slip , and go off suddenly , all on your own like Bilbo did . Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open , and done a good deal of planning on our own account . You are not going to escape so easily ! ’ 
 ‘ But I must go , ’ said Frodo . ‘ deal can not be helped , dear friends . deal is wretched for us all , but it is no use your trying to keep me . Since you have guessed so much , please help me and do not hinder me ! ’ 
 ‘ You do not understand ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ You must go – and therefore we must , too . Merry and I are coming with you . Sam is an excellent fellow , and would jump down a dragon ’s throat to save you , if Sam did not trip over Sam own feet ; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure . ’ 
 ‘ My dear and most beloved hobbits ! ’ said Frodo deeply moved . ‘ But I could not allow adventure . I decided that long ago , too . You speak of danger , but you do not understand . This is no treasure - hunt , no there - and - back journey . I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril . ’ 
 ‘ Of course we understand , ’ said Merry firmly . ‘ That is why we have decided to come . We know the Ring is no laughing - matter ; but we are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy . ’ 
 ‘ The Ring ! ’ said Frodo , now completely amazed . 
 ‘ Yes , the Ring , ’ said Merry . ‘ My dear old hobbit , you do n’t allow for the inquisitiveness of friends . I have known about the existence of the Ring for years – before Bilbo went away , in fact ; but since Bilbo obviously regarded knowledge as secret , I kept the knowledge in my head , until we formed our conspiracy . I did not know Bilbo , of course , as well as I know you ; I was too young , and Bilbo was also more careful – but Bilbo was not careful enough . If you want to know how I first found out , I will tell you . ’ 
 ‘ Go on ! ’ said Frodo faintly . 
 ‘ It was the Sackville - Bagginses that were Bilbo downfall , as you might expect . One day , a year before the Party , I happened to be walking along the road , when I saw Bilbo ahead . Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared , coming towards us . Bilbo slowed down , and then hey presto ! Bilbo vanished . I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion ; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside . I was peeping through into the road , after the S.-B.s had passed , and was looking straight at Bilbo when Bilbo suddenly reappeared . I caught a glint of gold as Bilbo put something back in Bilbo trouser - pocket . 
 ‘ After that I kept my eyes open . In fact , I confess that I spied . But you must admit that that was very intriguing , and I was only in my teens . I must be the only one in the Shire , besides you Frodo , that has ever seen the old fellow ’s secret book . ’ 
 ‘ You have read Frodo book ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ Good heavens above ! Is nothing safe ? ’ 
 ‘ Not too safe , I should say , ’ said Merry . ‘ But I have only had one rapid glance , and that was difficult to get . Frodo never left the book about . I wonder what became of book . I should like another look . Have you got book , Frodo ? ’ 
 ‘ No . book was not at Bag End . Frodo must have taken book away . ’ 
 ‘ Well , as I was saying , ’ Merry proceeded , ‘ I kept my knowledge to myself , till this spring when things got serious . Then we formed our conspiracy ; and as we were serious , too , and meant business , we have not been too scrupulous . You are not a very easy nut to crack , and Gandalf is worse . But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator , I can produce investigator . ’ 
 ‘ Where is investigator ? ’ said Frodo , looking round , as if Frodo expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard . 
 ‘ Step forward , Sam ! ’ said Merry ; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears . ‘ Here ’s our collector of information ! And investigator collected a lot , I can tell you , before investigator was finally caught . After which , I may say , investigator seemed to regard investigator as on parole , and dried up . ’ 
 ‘ Sam ! ’ cried Frodo , feeling that amazement could go no further , and quite unable to decide whether Frodo felt angry , amused , relieved , or merely foolish . 
 ‘ Yes , sir ! ’ said Sam . ‘ Begging your pardon , sir ! But I meant no wrong to you , Mr. Frodo , nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter . Gandalf has some sense , mind you ; and when you said go alone , Gandalf said no ! take someone as you can trust . ’ 
 ‘ But it does not seem that I can trust anyone , ’ said Frodo . 
 Sam looked at Frodo unhappily . ‘ anyone all depends on what you want , ’ put in Merry . ‘ You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin – to the bitter end . And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours – closer than you keep secret yourself . But you can not trust us to let you face trouble alone , and go off without a word . We are your friends , Frodo . Anyway : there Frodo is . We know most of what Gandalf has told you . We know a good deal about the Ring . We are horribly afraid – but we are coming with you ; or following you like hounds . ’ 
 ‘ And after all , sir , ’ added Sam , ‘ you did ought to take the Elves ’ advice . Gildor said you should take Gildor as was willing , and you ca n’t deny advice . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t deny deal , ’ said Frodo , looking at Sam , who was now grinning . ‘ I do n’t deny deal , but I ’ll never believe you are sleeping again , whether you snore or not . I shall kick you hard to make sure . 
 ‘ You are a set of deceitful scoundrels ! ’ Sam said , turning to the others . ‘ But bless you ! ’ Sam laughed , getting up and waving Sam arms , ‘ I give in . I will take Gildor ’s advice . If the danger were not so dark , I should dance for joy . Even so , I can not help feeling happy ; happier than I have felt for a long time . I had dreaded this evening . ’ 
 ‘ Good ! That ’s settled . Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company ! ’ cheers shouted ; and cheers danced round Frodo . Merry and Pippin began a song , which cheers had apparently got ready for the occasion . 
 song was made on the model of the dwarf - song that started Bilbo on Bilbo adventure long ago , and went to the same tune : 
 Farewell we call to hearth and hall ! 
 Though wind may blow and rain may fall , 
 We must away ere break of day 
 Far over wood and mountain tall . 
 To Rivendell , where Elves yet dwell 
 In glades beneath the misty fell , 
 Through moor and waste we ride in haste , 
 And whither then we can not tell . 
 With foes ahead , behind us dread , 
 Beneath the sky shall be our bed , 
 Until at last our toil be passed , 
 Our journey done , our errand sped . 
 We must away ! We must away ! 
 We ride before the break of day ! 
 ‘ Very good ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ But in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed – under a roof , for tonight at any rate . ’ 
 ‘ Oh ! That was poetry ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ Do you really mean to start before the break of day ? ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ I fear those Black Riders , and I am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long , especially in a place to which it is known I was going . Also Gildor advised me not to wait . But I should very much like to see Gandalf . I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when Gildor heard that Gandalf had never appeared . place really depends on two things . How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury ? And how soon could we get off ? Bucklebury will take a good deal of preparation . ’ 
 ‘ The answer to the second question , ’ said Merry , ‘ is that we could get off in an hour . I have prepared practically everything . There are five ponies in a stable across the fields ; stores and tackle are all packed , except for a few extra clothes , and the perishable food . ’ 
 ‘ It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But what about the Black Riders ? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf ? ’ 
 ‘ That all depends on what you think the Riders would do , if Riders found you here , ’ answered Merry . ‘ Riders could have reached here by now , of course , if Riders were not stopped at the North - gate , where the Hedge runs down to the riverbank , just this side of the Bridge . The gate - guards would not let Riders through by night , though Riders might break through . Even in the daylight Riders would try to keep guards out , I think , at any rate until Riders got a message through to the Master of the Hall – for Riders would not like the look of the Riders , and would certainly be frightened by guards . But , of course , Buckland can not resist a determined attack for long . And it is possible that in the morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through . It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow . ’ 
 Frodo sat for a while in thought . ‘ I have made up my mind , ’ Frodo said finally . ‘ I am starting tomorrow , as soon as mind is light . But I am not going by road : it would be safer to wait here than that . If I go through the North - gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once , instead of being secret for several days at least , as departure might be . And what is more , the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched , whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not . We do n’t know how many there are ; but there are at least two , and possibly more . The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction . ’ 
 ‘ But that can only mean going into the Old Forest ! ’ said Fredegar horrified . ‘ You ca n’t be thinking of doing that . that is quite as dangerous as Black Riders . ’ 
 ‘ Not quite , ’ said Merry . ‘ that sounds very desperate , but I believe Frodo is right . that is the only way of getting off without being followed at once . With luck we might get a considerable start . ’ 
 ‘ But you wo n’t have any luck in the Old Forest , ’ objected Fredegar . ‘ No one ever has luck in there . You ’ll get lost . People do n’t go in there . ’ 
 ‘ Oh yes People do ! ’ said Merry . ‘ The Brandybucks go in – occasionally when the fit takes People . We have a private entrance . Frodo went in once , long ago . I have been in several times : usually in daylight , of course , when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet . ’ 
 ‘ Well , do as you think best ! ’ said Fredegar . ‘ I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about : the stories about anything are a nightmare ; but my vote hardly counts , as I am not going on the journey . Still , I am very glad someone is stopping behind , who can tell Gandalf what you have done , when someone turns up , as I am sure someone will before long . ’ 
 Fond as Bolger was of Frodo , Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire , nor to see what lay outside Shire . Bolger family came from the Eastfarthing , from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact , but Bolger had never been over the Brandywine Bridge . Bolger task , according to the original plans of the conspirators , was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk , and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow . Baggins had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo ’s to help Bolger in playing the part . clothes little thought how dangerous that part might prove . 
 ‘ Excellent ! ’ said Frodo , when Bolger understood the plan . ‘ We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise . I do n’t know whether these Riders can read or not , of course , but I should not have dared to risk a written message , in case Riders got in and searched the house . But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort , and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone , that decides me . I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow . ’ 
 ‘ Well , that ’s that , ’ said Pippin . ‘ On the whole I would rather have our job than Fatty ’s – waiting here till Black Riders come . ’ 
 ‘ You wait till you are well inside the Forest , ’ said Fredegar . ‘ You ’ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow . ’ 
 ‘ time ’s no good arguing about Fatty any more , ’ said Merry . ‘ We have still got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing , before we get to bed . I shall call you all before the break of day . ’ 
 When at last Frodo had got to bed , Frodo could not sleep for some time . Frodo legs ached . Frodo was glad that Frodo was riding in the morning . Eventually Frodo fell into a vague dream , in which Frodo seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees . Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling . Frodo felt sure creatures would smell Frodo out sooner or later . 
 Then Frodo heard a noise in the distance . At first Frodo thought noise was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest . Then Frodo knew that noise was not leaves , but the sound of the Sea far - off ; a sound Frodo had never heard in waking life , though noise had often troubled Frodo dreams . Suddenly Frodo found Frodo was out in the open . There were no trees after all . Frodo was on a dark heath , and there was a strange salt smell in the air . Looking up Frodo saw before him a tall white tower , standing alone on a high ridge . A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea . Frodo started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower : but suddenly a light came in the sky , and there was a noise of thunder . 
 Chapter 6 
 THE OLD FOREST 
 Frodo woke suddenly . Chapter was still dark in the room . Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand , and banging on the door with the other . ‘ All right ! What is Chapter ? ’ said Frodo , still shaken and bewildered . 
 ‘ What is Chapter ! ’ cried Merry . ‘ It is time to get up . Chapter is half past four and very foggy . Come on ! Sam is already getting breakfast ready . Even Pippin is up . I am just going to saddle the ponies , and fetch the one that is to be the baggage - carrier . Wake that sluggard Fatty ! At least sluggard must get up and see us off . ’ 
 Soon after six o’clock the five hobbits were ready to start . Fatty Bolger was still yawning . hobbits stole quietly out of the house . Merry went in front leading a laden pony , and took Bolger way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house , and then cut across several fields . The leaves of trees were glistening , and every twig was dripping ; the grass was grey with cold dew . Everything was still , and far - away noises seemed near and clear : fowls chattering in a yard , someone closing a door of a distant house . 
 In fowls shed fowls found the ponies : sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits , not speedy , but good for a long day ’s work . fowls mounted , and soon fowls were riding off into the mist , which seemed to open reluctantly before fowls and close forbiddingly behind fowls . After riding for about an hour , slowly and without talking , fowls saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead . Hedge was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs . 
 ‘ How are you going to get through this ? ’ asked Fredegar . 
 ‘ Follow me ! ’ said Merry , ‘ and you will see . ’ Fredegar turned to the left along the Hedge , and soon fowls came to a point where left bent inwards , running along the lip of a hollow . A cutting had been made , at some distance from the Hedge , and went sloping gently down into the ground . cutting had walls of brick at the sides , which rose steadily , until suddenly walls arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side . 
 Here Fatty Bolger halted . ‘ Good - bye , Frodo ! ’ Bolger said . ‘ I wish you were not going into the Forest . I only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out . But good luck to you – today and every day ! ’ 
 ‘ If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest , I shall be lucky , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road : we shall soon be back on Gandalf and going as fast as we can . ’ ‘ Good - bye ! ’ Road cried , and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar ’s sight into the tunnel . 
 Fredegar was dark and damp . At the far end Fredegar was closed by a gate of thick - set iron bars . Merry got down and unlocked the gate , and when bars had all passed through Merry pushed gate to again . gate shut with a clang , and the lock clicked . The sound was ominous . 
 ‘ There ! ’ said Merry . ‘ You have left the Shire , and are now outside , and on the edge of the Old Forest . ’ 
 ‘ Are the stories about Shire true ? ’ asked Pippin . 
 ‘ I do n’t know what stories you mean , ’ Merry answered . ‘ If you mean the old bogey - stories Fatty ’s nurses used to tell Forest , about goblins and wolves and things of that sort , I should say no . At any rate I do n’t believe nurses . But the Forest is queer . Everything in rate is very much more alive , more aware of what is going on , so to speak , than things are in the Shire . And the trees do not like strangers . trees watch you . trees are usually content merely to watch you , as long as daylight lasts , and do n’t do much . Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch , or stick a root out , or grasp at you with a long trailer . But at night things can be most alarming , or so I am told . I have only once or twice been in here after dark , and then only near the hedge . I thought all the trees were whispering to each other , passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language ; and the branches swayed and groped without any wind . branches do say the trees do actually move , and can surround strangers and hem strangers in . In fact long ago strangers attacked the Hedge : strangers came and planted strangers right by Hedge , and leaned over Hedge . But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees , and made a great bonfire in the Forest , and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge . After that the trees gave up the attack , but trees became very unfriendly . There is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made . ’ 
 ‘ Is it only the trees that are dangerous ? ’ asked Pippin . 
 ‘ There are various queer things living deep in the Forest , and on the far side , ’ said Merry , ‘ or at least I have heard so ; but I have never seen any of things . But something makes paths . Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks ; but tracks seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion . Not far from this tunnel there is , or was for a long time , the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade , and then on more or less in our direction , east and a little north . That is the path I am going to try and find . ’ 
 The hobbits now left the tunnel - gate and rode across the wide hollow . On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest , a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge ; but Hedge vanished as soon as Hedge brought hobbits under the trees . Looking back hobbits could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about hobbits . Looking ahead hobbits could see only tree - trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes : straight or bent , twisted , leaning , squat or slender , smooth or gnarled and branched ; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy , shaggy growths . 
 Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful . ‘ You had better lead on and find that path , ’ Frodo said to Forest . ‘ Do n’t let us lose one another , or forget which way the Hedge lies ! ’ 
 hobbits picked a way among the trees , and hobbits ponies plodded along , carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots . There was no undergrowth . The ground was rising steadily , and as trees went forward it seemed that the trees became taller , darker , and thicker . There was no sound , except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves . For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches ; but branches all got an uncomfortable feeling that branches were being watched with disapproval , deepening to dislike and even enmity . The feeling steadily grew , until branches found branches looking up quickly , or glancing back over branches shoulders , as if branches expected a sudden blow . 
 There was not as yet any sign of a path , and the trees seemed constantly to bar trees way . Pippin suddenly felt that Pippin could not bear way any longer , and without warning let out a shout . ‘ Oi ! Oi ! ’ Pippin cried . ‘ I am not going to do anything . Just let me pass through , will you ! ’ 
 The others halted startled ; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain . There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before . 
 ‘ I should not shout , if I were you , ’ said Merry . ‘ anything does more harm than good . ’ 
 Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through , and if Frodo had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood . Merry was looking from side to side , and seemed already uncertain which way to go . Pippin noticed Merry . ‘ anything has not taken you long to lose us , ’ Pippin said . But at that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead . 
 ‘ Well , well ! ’ Pippin said . ‘ These trees do shift . There is the Bonfire Glade in front of us ( or I hope so ) , but the path to Glade seems to have moved away ! ’ 
 The light grew clearer as light went forward . Suddenly light came out of the trees and found light in a wide circular space . There was sky above light , blue and clear to light surprise , for down under the Forest - roof light had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist . The sun was not , however , high enough yet to shine down into the clearing , though sun light was on the tree - tops . The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade , enclosing glade with an almost solid wall . No tree grew there , only rough grass and many tall plants : stalky and faded hemlocks and wood - parsley , fire - weed seeding into fluffy ashes , and rampant nettles and thistles . A dreary place : but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close Forest . 
 The hobbits felt encouraged , and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky . At the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees , and a clear path beyond break . trees could see break running on into the wood , wide in places and open above , though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed break with trees dark boughs . Up this path trees rode . trees were still climbing gently , but trees now went much quicker , and with better heart ; for it seemed to trees that the Forest had relented , and was going to let trees pass unhindered after all . 
 But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy . The trees drew close again on either side , and trees could no longer see far ahead . Now stronger than ever trees felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on trees . So silent was it that the fall of trees ponies ’ hoofs , rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots , seemed to thud in trees ears . Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage trees , but Frodo voice sank to a murmur . 
 O ! Wanderers in the shadowed land 
 despair not ! For though dark Wanderers stand , 
 all woods there be must end at last , 
 and see the open sun go past : 
 the setting sun , the rising sun 
 the day ’s end , or the day begun . 
 For east or west all woods must fail ... 
 Fail – even as Frodo said the word Frodo voice faded into silence . The air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome . Just behind words a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path . The trees seemed to close in before words . 
 ‘ words do not like all that about ending and failing , ’ said Merry . ‘ I should not sing any more at present . Wait till we do get to the edge , and then we ’ll turn and give words a rousing chorus ! ’ 
 Merry spoke cheerfully , and if Merry felt any great anxiety , Merry did not show anxiety . The others did not answer . others were depressed . A heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodo ’s heart , and Frodo regretted now with every step forward that Frodo had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees . Frodo was , indeed , just about to stop and propose going back ( if that was still possible ) , when things took a new turn . The path stopped climbing , and became for a while nearly level . The dark trees drew aside , and ahead trees could see the path going almost straight forward . Before trees , but some distance off , there stood a green hill - top , treeless , rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood . The path seemed to be making directly for wood . 
 trees now hurried forward again , delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest . The path dipped , and then again began to climb upwards , leading trees at last to the foot of the steep hillside . There path left the trees and faded into the turf . The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown . 
 The hobbits led hobbits ponies up , winding round and round until hobbits reached the top . There hobbits stood and gazed about ponies . The air was gleaming and sunlit , but hazy ; and ponies could not see to any great distance . Near at hand the mist was now almost gone ; though here and there mist lay in hollows of the wood , and to the south of ponies , out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest , the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke . 
 ‘ That , ’ said Merry , pointing with Merry hand , ‘ that is the line of the Withywindle . that comes down out of the Downs and flows south - west through the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend . We do n’t want to go that way ! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood – the centre from which all the queerness comes , as valley were . ’ 
 The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out , but others could see little but mists over the damp and deep - cut valley ; and beyond valley the southern half of the Forest faded from view . 
 The sun on the hill - top was now getting hot . sun must have been about eleven o’clock ; but the autumn haze still prevented others from seeing much in other directions . In the west others could not make out either the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond sun . Northward , where others looked most hopefully , others could see nothing that might be the line of the great East Road , for which others were making . others were on an island in a sea of trees , and the horizon was veiled . 
 On the south - eastern side the ground fell very steeply , as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees , like island - shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters . slopes sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below shores , while shores ate shores mid - day meal . As the sun rose and passed noon shores glimpsed far off in the east the grey - green lines of the Downs that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side . That cheered shores greatly ; for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood ’s borders , though shores did not mean to go that way , if shores could help reputation : the Barrow - downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit - legend as the Forest reputation . 
 At length shores made up shores minds to go on again . The path that had brought shores to the hill reappeared on the northward side ; but shores had not followed path far before shores became aware that path was bending steadily to the right . Soon path began to descend rapidly and shores guessed that path must actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley : not at all the direction shores wished to take . After some discussion shores decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward ; for although shores had not been able to see Road from the hill - top , the Road must lie that way , and Road could not be many miles off . Also northward , and to the left of the path , the land seemed to be drier and more open , climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner , and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood . 
 At first oaks choice seemed to be good : oaks got along at a fair speed , though whenever oaks got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade oaks seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards . But after a time the trees began to close in again , just where trees had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled . Then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly , like the ruts of great giant - wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles . These lay usually right across These line of march , and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again , which was troublesome and difficult with These ponies . Each time These climbed down These found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth , which somehow would not yield to the left , but only gave way when These turned to the right ; and These had to go some distance along the bottom before These could find a way up the further bank . Each time These clambered out , the trees seemed deeper and darker ; and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way , and trees were forced to the right and downwards . 
 After an hour or two trees had lost all clear sense of direction , though trees knew well enough that trees had long ceased to go northward at all . trees were being headed off , and were simply following a course chosen for These – eastwards and southwards , into the heart of the Forest and not out of course . 
 The afternoon was wearing away when These scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any These had yet met . It was so steep and overhung that afternoon proved impossible to climb out of any again , either forwards or backwards , without leaving These ponies and These baggage behind . All These could do was to follow the fold – downwards . The ground grew soft , and in places boggy ; springs appeared in the banks , and soon springs found springs following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed . Then the ground began to fall rapidly , and the brook growing strong and noisy , flowed and leaped swiftly downhill . springs were in a deep dim - lit gully over - arched by trees high above springs . 
 After stumbling along for some way along the stream , springs came quite suddenly out of the gloom . As if through a gate springs saw the sunlight before trees . Coming to the opening trees found that trees had made trees way down through a cleft in a high steep bank , almost a cliff . At bank feet was a wide space of grass and reeds ; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep . A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between . In the midst of land there wound lazily a dark river of brown water , bordered with ancient willows , arched over with willows , blocked with fallen willows , and flecked with thousands of faded willow - leaves . The air was thick with willows , fluttering yellow from the branches ; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley , and the reeds were rustling , and the willow - boughs were creaking . 
 ‘ Well , now I have at least some notion of where we are ! ’ said Merry . ‘ We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended . This is the River Withywindle ! I will go on and explore . ’ 
 Withywindle passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses . After a while Merry reappeared , and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the cliff - foot and the river ; in some places firm turf went down to the water ’s edge . ‘ What ’s more , ’ foot said , ‘ there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on this side of the river . If we turn left and follow river , we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest eventually . ’ 
 ‘ I dare say ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ That is , if the track goes on so far , and does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there . Who made the track , do you suppose , and why ? I am sure track was not for our benefit . I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in track , and I begin to believe all the stories about track . And have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go ? ’ 
 ‘ No , ’ said Merry , ‘ I have n’t . I do n’t know in the least how far down the Withywindle we are , or who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along Withywindle . But there is no other way out that I can see or think of . ’ 
 There being nothing else for Withywindle , Merry filed out , and Merry led stories to the path that Forest had discovered . Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall , in places far above reeds heads ; but once found , the path was easy to follow , as path turned and twisted , picking out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools . Here and there path passed over other rills , running down gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forest - lands , and at these points there were tree - trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across . 
 The hobbits began to feel very hot . There were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round armies ears , and the afternoon sun was burning on armies backs . At last armies came suddenly into a thin shade ; great grey branches reached across the path . Each step forward became more reluctant than the last . Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up armies legs , and falling softly out of the air upon armies heads and eyes . 
 Frodo felt Frodo chin go down and Sleepiness head nod . Just in front of sun Pippin fell forward on to Pippin knees . Frodo halted . ‘ front ’s no good , ’ Pippin heard Merry saying . ‘ Ca n’t go another step without rest . Must have nap . front ’s cool under the willows . Less flies ! ’ 
 Frodo did not like the sound of this . ‘ Come on ! ’ Frodo cried . ‘ We ca n’t have a nap yet . We must get clear of the Forest first . ’ But the others were too far gone to care . Beside others Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly . 
 Suddenly Frodo Frodo felt sleep overwhelming Sam . Sam head swam . There now seemed hardly a sound in the air . The flies had stopped buzzing . Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing , a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered , seemed to stir in the boughs above . Sam lifted Sam heavy eyes and saw leaning over head a huge willow - tree , old and hoary . Enormous tree looked , tree sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long - fingered hands , tree knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved . The leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled head , and head toppled over , lying where head fell upon the grass . 
 Merry and Pippin dragged Merry forward and lay down with Merry backs to the willow - trunk . Behind Merry the great cracks gaped wide to receive Merry as the tree swayed and creaked . Merry looked up at the grey and yellow leaves , moving softly against the light , and singing . Merry shut Merry eyes , and then it seemed that Merry could almost hear words , cool words , saying something about water and sleep . Merry gave Merry up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow . 
 Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering grey ; then with an effort grey struggled to grey feet again . grey felt a compelling desire for cool water . ‘ Wait for me , Sam , ’ grey stammered . ‘ Must bathe feet a minute . ’ 
 Half in a dream grey wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree , where great winding roots grew out into the stream , like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink . grey straddled one of these , and paddled grey hot feet in the cool brown water ; and there grey too suddenly fell asleep with grey back against the tree . 
 Sam sat down and scratched Sam head , and yawned like a cavern . Sam was worried . The afternoon was getting late , and Sam thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny . ‘ There ’s more behind this than sun and warm air , ’ Sam muttered to Sam . ‘ I do n’t like this great big tree . I do n’t trust tree . Hark at tree singing about sleep now ! This wo n’t do at all ! ’ 
 Sam pulled Sam to Sam feet , and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies . Sam found that two had wandered on a good way along the path ; and Sam had just caught two and brought two back towards the others , when Sam heard two noises ; one loud , and the other soft but very clear . One was the splash of something heavy falling into the water ; the other was a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast . 
 Sam rushed back to the bank . Frodo was in the water close to the edge , and a great tree - root seemed to be over Frodo and holding Frodo down , but Frodo was not struggling . Sam gripped Frodo by the jacket , and dragged Frodo from under the root ; and then with difficulty hauled Frodo on to the bank . Almost at once Frodo woke , and coughed and spluttered . 
 ‘ Do you know , Sam , ’ Frodo said at length , ‘ the beastly tree threw me in ! I felt tree . The big root just twisted round and tipped me in ! ’ 
 ‘ You were dreaming I expect , Mr. Frodo , ’ said Sam . ‘ You should n’t sit in such a place , if you feel sleepy . ’ 
 ‘ What about the others ? ’ Frodo asked . ‘ I wonder what sort of dreams others are having . ’ 
 others went round to the other side of the tree , and then Sam understood the click that Sam had heard . Pippin had vanished . The crack by which Sam had laid Sam had closed together , so that not a chink could be seen . Merry was trapped : another crack had closed about Sam waist ; Sam legs lay outside , but the rest of Sam was inside a dark opening , the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers . 
 Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree - trunk where Pippin had lain . Sam then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor Merry . crack was quite useless . 
 ‘ What a foul thing to happen ! ’ cried Frodo wildly . ‘ Why did we ever come into this dreadful Forest ? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow ! ’ Frodo kicked the tree with all Frodo strength , heedless of Frodo own feet . A hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches ; the leaves rustled and whispered , but with a sound now of faint and far - off laughter . 
 ‘ I suppose we have n’t got an axe among our luggage , Mr. Frodo ? ’ asked Sam . 
 ‘ I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood , ’ said Frodo . ‘ That would n’t be much use . ’ 
 ‘ Wait a minute ! ’ cried Sam , struck by an idea suggested by firewood . ‘ We might do something with fire ! ’ 
 ‘ We might , ’ said Frodo doubtfully . ‘ We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside . ’ 
 ‘ We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with , ’ said Sam fiercely . ‘ If tree do n’t let Sam go , I ’ll have tree down , if I have to gnaw tree . ’ Frodo ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder - boxes and a hatchet . 
 Quickly ponies gathered dry grass and leaves , and bits of bark ; and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks . These ponies heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners . As soon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder , spark kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up . The twigs crackled . Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched fire . A tremor ran through the whole willow . The leaves seemed to hiss above leaves heads with a sound of pain and anger . A loud scream came from Merry , and from far inside the tree leaves heard Pippin give a muffled yell . 
 ‘ Put yell out ! Put yell out ! ’ cried Merry . ‘ Merry ’ll squeeze me in two , if you do n’t . Merry says so ! ’ 
 ‘ Who ? What ? ’ shouted Frodo , rushing round to the other side of the tree . 
 ‘ Put yell out ! Put yell out ! ’ begged Merry . The branches of the willow began to sway violently . There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about , as though branches had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river - valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest . Sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparks . But Frodo , without any clear idea of why Frodo did so , or what Frodo hoped for , ran along the path crying help ! help ! help ! It seemed to Frodo that Frodo could hardly hear the sound of Frodo own shrill voice : it was blown away from Frodo by the willow - wind and drowned in a clamour of leaves , as soon as the words left Frodo mouth . Frodo felt desperate : lost and witless . 
 Suddenly Frodo stopped . There was an answer , or so Frodo thought ; but it seemed to come from behind Frodo , away down the path further back in the Forest . Frodo turned round and listened , and soon there could be no doubt : someone was singing a song ; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily , but voice was singing nonsense : 
 Hey dol ! merry dol ! ring a dong dillo ! 
 Ring a dong ! hop along ! fal lal the willow ! 
 Tom Bom , jolly Tom , Tom Bombadillo ! 
 Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger , Frodo and Sam now both stood still . Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense - words ( or so Frodo seemed ) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song : 
 Hey ! Come merry dol ! derry dol ! My darling ! 
 Light goes the weather - wind and the feathered starling . 
 Down along under Hill , shining in the sunlight , 
 Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight , 
 There my pretty lady is , River - woman ’s daughter , 
 Slender as the willow - wand , clearer than the water . 
 Old Tom Bombadil water - lilies bringing 
 Comes hopping home again . Can you hear starling singing ? 
 Hey ! Come merry dol ! derry dol ! and merry - o , 
 Goldberry , Goldberry , merry yellow berry - o ! 
 Poor old Willow - man , you tuck your roots away ! 
 Tom ’s in a hurry now . Evening will follow day . 
 Tom ’s going home again water - lilies bringing . 
 Hey ! Come derry dol ! Can you hear me singing ? 
 Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted . The wind puffed out . The leaves hung silently again on stiff branches . There was another burst of song , and then suddenly , hopping and dancing along the path , there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band . With another hop and a bound there came into view a man , or so it seemed . At any rate man was too large and heavy for a hobbit , if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People , though man made noise enough for one , stumping along with great yellow boots on man thick legs , and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink . man had a blue coat and a long brown beard ; man eyes were blue and bright , and man face was red as a ripe apple , but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter . In man hands man carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water - lilies . 
 ‘ Help ! ’ cried Frodo and Sam running towards man with Frodo hands stretched out . 
 ‘ Whoa ! Whoa ! steady there ! ’ cried the old Sam , holding up one hand , and Frodo stopped short , as if Frodo had been struck stiff . ‘ Now , my little fellows , where be you a - going to , puffing like a bellows ? What ’s the matter here then ? Do you know who I am ? I ’m Tom Bombadil . Tell me what ’s your trouble ! Tom ’s in a hurry now . Do n’t you crush my lilies ! ’ 
 ‘ My friends are caught in the willow - tree , ’ cried Frodo breathlessly . 
 ‘ Master Merry ’s being squeezed in a crack ! ’ cried Sam . ‘ What ? ’ shouted Tom Bombadil , leaping up in the air . ‘ Old Man Willow ? Naught worse than that , eh ? That can soon be mended . I know the tune for Willow . Old grey Willow - man ! I ’ll freeze man marrow cold , if man do n’t behave man . I ’ll sing man roots off . I ’ll sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away . Old Man Willow ! ’ 
 Setting down Willow lilies carefully on the grass , man ran to the tree . There man saw Merry ’s feet still sticking out – the rest had already been drawn further inside . Tom put Tom mouth to the crack and began singing into crack in a low voice . mouth could not catch the words , but evidently Merry was aroused . Tom legs began to kick . Tom sprang away , and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with branch . ‘ You let mouth out again , Old Man Willow ! ’ Tom said . ‘ What be you a - thinking of ? You should not be waking . Eat earth ! Dig deep ! Drink water ! Go to sleep ! Bombadil is talking ! ’ Bombadil then seized Merry ’s feet and drew Merry out of the suddenly widening crack . 
 There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open , and out of creak Pippin sprang , as if Pippin had been kicked . Then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again . A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip , and complete silence fell . 
 ‘ Thank you ! ’ said the hobbits , one after the other . 
 Tom Bombadil burst out laughing . ‘ Well , my little fellows ! ’ said Bombadil , stooping so that Bombadil peered into hobbits faces . ‘ You shall come home with me ! The table is all laden with yellow cream , honeycomb , and white bread and butter . Goldberry is waiting . Time enough for questions around the supper table . You follow after me as quick as you are able ! ’ With that Goldberry picked up Goldberry lilies , and then with a beckoning wave of Goldberry hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward , still singing loudly and nonsensically . 
 Too surprised and too relieved to talk , the hobbits followed after Goldberry as fast as hobbits could . But that was not fast enough . Tom soon disappeared in front of hobbits , and the noise of Tom singing got fainter and further away . Suddenly Tom voice came floating back to hobbits in a loud halloo ! 
 Hop along , my little friends , up the Withywindle ! 
 Tom ’s going on ahead candles for to kindle . 
 Down west sinks the Sun : soon you will be groping . 
 When the night - shadows fall , then the door will open , 
 Out of the window - panes light will twinkle yellow . 
 Fear no alder black ! Heed no hoary willow ! 
 Fear neither root nor bough ! Tom goes on before you . 
 Hey now ! merry dol ! We ’ll be waiting for you ! 
 After that the hobbits heard no more . Almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind hobbits . hobbits thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the Brandywine River , and the windows of Bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights . Great shadows fell across hobbits ; trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path . White mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon river borders . Out of the very ground at borders feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk . 
 steam became difficult to follow the path , and borders were very tired . borders legs seemed leaden . Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on either side of borders ; and if borders looked up to the pale sky , borders caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight , and leered down at faces from the high bank and the edges of the wood . faces began to feel that all this country was unreal , and that faces were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening . 
 Just as faces felt faces feet slowing down to a standstill , faces noticed that the ground was gently rising . The water began to murmur . In the darkness faces caught the white glimmer of foam , where the river flowed over a short fall . Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind . trees stepped out from the Forest , and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before trees . The river , now small and swift , was leaping merrily down to meet trees , glinting here and there in the light of the stars , which were already shining in the sky . 
 The grass under grass feet was smooth and short , as if river had been mown or shaven . The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped , and trim as a hedge . The path was now plain before eaves , well - tended and bordered with stone . path wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll , now grey under the pale starry night ; and there , still high above eaves on a further slope , eaves saw the twinkling lights of a house . Down again the path went , and then up again , up a long smooth hillside of turf , towards the light . Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened . There was Tom Bombadil ’s house before eaves , up , down , under hill . Behind house a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare , and beyond that the dark shapes of the Barrow - downs stalked away into the eastern night . 
 shapes all hurried forward , hobbits and ponies . Already half shapes weariness and all shapes fears had fallen from shapes . Hey ! Come merry dol ! rolled out the song to greet shapes . 
 Hey ! Come derry dol ! Hop along , my hearties ! 
 Hobbits ! Ponies all ! We are fond of parties . 
 Now let the fun begin ! Let us sing together ! 
 Then another clear voice , as young and as ancient as Spring , like the song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills , came falling like silver to meet hills : 
 Now let the song begin ! Let us sing together 
 Of sun , stars , moon and mist , rain and cloudy weather , 
 Light on the budding leaf , dew on the feather , 
 Wind on the open hill , bells on the heather , 
 Reeds by the shady pool , lilies on the water : 
 Old Tom Bombadil and the River - daughter ! 
 And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold , and a golden light was all about hobbits . 
 Chapter 7 
 IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL 
 The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold , and stood still , blinking . hobbits were in a long low room , filled with the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof ; and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles , tall and yellow , burning brightly . 
 In a chair , at the far side of the room facing the outer door , sat a woman . daughter long yellow hair rippled down daughter shoulders ; daughter gown was green , green as young reeds , shot with silver like beads of dew ; and daughter belt was of gold , shaped like a chain of flag - lilies set with the pale - blue eyes of forget - me - nots . About daughter feet in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware , white water - lilies were floating , so that daughter seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool . 
 ‘ Enter , good guests ! ’ daughter said , and as daughter spoke lilies knew that it was daughter clear voice lilies had heard singing . lilies came a few timid steps further into the room , and began to bow low , feeling strangely surprised and awkward , like folk that , knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water , have been answered by a fair young elf - queen clad in living flowers . But before lilies could say anything , daughter sprang lightly up and over the lily - bowls , and ran laughing towards lilies ; and as daughter ran daughter gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river . 
 ‘ Come dear folk ! ’ daughter said , taking Frodo by the hand . ‘ Laugh and be merry ! I am Goldberry , daughter of the River . ’ Then lightly daughter passed hand and closing the door daughter turned daughter back to door , with daughter white arms spread out across door . ‘ Let us shut out the night ! ’ daughter said . ‘ For you are still afraid , perhaps , of mist and tree - shadows and deep water , and untame things . Fear nothing ! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil . ’ 
 The hobbits looked at daughter in wonder ; and daughter looked at each of hobbits and smiled . ‘ Fair lady Goldberry ! ’ said Frodo at last , feeling Frodo heart moved with a joy that Frodo did not understand . Frodo stood as Frodo had at times stood enchanted by fair elven - voices ; but the spell that was now laid upon Frodo was different : less keen and lofty was the delight , but deeper and nearer to mortal heart ; marvellous and yet not strange . ‘ Fair lady Goldberry ! ’ Frodo said again . ‘ Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me . 
 O slender as a willow - wand ! O clearer than clear water ! 
 O reed by the living pool ! Fair River - daughter ! 
 O spring - time and summer - time , and spring again after ! 
 O wind on the waterfall , and the leaves ’ laughter ! ’ 
 Suddenly River stopped and stammered , overcome with surprise to hear River saying such things . But Goldberry laughed . 
 ‘ Welcome ! ’ Goldberry said . ‘ I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so sweet - tongued . But I see that you are an Elf - friend ; the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells folk . This is a merry meeting ! Sit now , and wait for the Master of the house ! friend will not be long . friend is tending your tired beasts . ’ 
 The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush - seated chairs , while Goldberry busied Goldberry about the table ; and hobbits eyes followed Goldberry , for the slender grace of Goldberry movement filled hobbits with quiet delight . From somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing . Every now and again hobbits caught , among many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words : 
 Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow ; 
 Bright blue Bombadil jacket is , and fellow boots are yellow . 
 ‘ Fair lady ! ’ said Frodo again after a while . ‘ Tell me , if my asking does not seem foolish , who is Tom Bombadil ? ’ 
 ‘ friend is , ’ said Goldberry , staying Goldberry swift movements and smiling . 
 Frodo looked at Goldberry questioningly . ‘ friend is , as you have seen friend , ’ Goldberry said in answer to friend look . ‘ friend is the Master of wood , water , and hill . ’ 
 ‘ Then all this strange land belongs to friend ? ’ 
 ‘ No indeed ! ’ Goldberry answered , and Goldberry smile faded . ‘ That would indeed be a burden , ’ Goldberry added in a low voice , as if to Goldberry . ‘ The trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to each . Tom Bombadil is the Master . No one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest , wading in the water , leaping on the hill - tops under light and shadow . Bombadil has no fear . Tom Bombadil is master . ’ 
 A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil . Bombadil had now no hat and Bombadil thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves . Bombadil laughed , and going to Goldberry , took Goldberry hand . 
 ‘ Here ’s my pretty lady ! ’ Bombadil said , bowing to the hobbits . ‘ Here ’s my Goldberry clothed all in silver - green with flowers in Goldberry girdle ! Is the table laden ? I see yellow cream and honeycomb , and white bread , and butter ; milk , cheese , and green herbs and ripe berries gathered . Is that enough for us ? Is the supper ready ? ’ 
 ‘ supper is , ’ said Goldberry ; ‘ but the guests perhaps are not ? ’ 
 Tom clapped Tom hands and cried : ‘ Tom , Tom ! your guests are tired , and you had near forgotten ! Come now , my merry friends , and Tom will refresh you ! You shall clean grimy hands , and wash your weary faces ; cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles ! ’ 
 Tom opened the door , and hands followed Tom down a short passage and round a sharp turn . hands came to a low room with a sloping roof ( a penthouse , it seemed , built on to the north end of the house ) . penthouse walls were of clean stone , but walls were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains . The floor was flagged , and strewn with fresh green rushes . There were four deep mattresses , each piled with white blankets , laid on the floor along one side . Against the opposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins , and beside bench stood brown ewers filled with water , some cold , some steaming hot . There were soft green slippers set ready beside each bed . 
 Before long , washed and refreshed , the hobbits were seated at the table , two on each side , while at either end sat Goldberry and the Master . two was a long and merry meal . Though the hobbits ate , as only famished hobbits can eat , there was no lack . The drink in hobbits drinking - bowls seemed to be clear cold water , yet drink went to hobbits hearts like wine and set free hobbits voices . The guests became suddenly aware that guests were singing merrily , as if drink was easier and more natural than talking . 
 At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly . The guests were commanded to sit quiet , and were set in chairs , each with a footstool to Goldberry tired feet . There was a fire in the wide hearth before chairs , and fire was burning with a sweet smell , as if fire were built of apple - wood . When everything was set in order , all the lights in the room were put out , except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the chimney - shelf . Then Goldberry came and stood before candles , holding a candle ; and Goldberry wished candles each a good night and deep sleep . 
 ‘ Have peace now , ’ Goldberry said , ‘ until the morning ! Heed no nightly noises ! For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill - top . Good night ! ’ Goldberry passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle . The sound of Goldberry footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night . 
 Tom sat on a while beside stones in silence , while each of stones tried to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions Tom had meant to ask at supper . Sleep gathered on stones eyelids . At last Frodo spoke : 
 ‘ Did you hear me calling , Master , or was night just chance that brought you at that moment ? ’ 
 Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream . ‘ Eh , what ? ’ said Tom . ‘ Did I hear you calling ? Nay , I did not hear : I was busy singing . Just chance brought me then , if chance you call chance . It was no plan of mine , though I was waiting for you . We heard news of you , and learned that you were wandering . We guessed you ’d come ere long down to the water : all paths lead that way , down to Withywindle . Old grey Willow - man , Withywindle ’s a mighty singer ; and singer ’s hard for little folk to escape Withywindle cunning mazes . But Tom had an errand there , that Tom dared not hinder . ’ Tom nodded as if sleep was taking Tom again ; but Tom went on in a soft singing voice : 
 I had an errand there : gathering water - lilies , 
 green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady , 
 the last ere the year ’s end to keep snows from the winter , 
 to flower by lady pretty feet till the snows are melted . 
 Each year at summer ’s end I go to find snows for lady , 
 in a wide pool , deep and clear , far down Withywindle ; 
 there snows open first in spring and there snows linger latest . 
 By that pool long ago I found the River - daughter , 
 fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes . 
 Sweet was daughter singing then , and daughter heart was beating ! 
 Goldberry opened Goldberry eyes and looked at eyes with a sudden glint of blue : 
 And that proved well for you – for now I shall no longer 
 go down deep again along the forest - water , 
 not while the year is old . Nor shall I be passing 
 Old Man Willow ’s house this side of spring - time , 
 not till the merry spring , when the River - daughter 
 dances down the withy - path to bathe in the water . 
 Goldberry fell silent again ; but Frodo could not help asking one more question : the one Goldberry most desired to have answered . ‘ Tell us , Master , ’ Goldberry said , ‘ about the Willow - Goldberry . What is Goldberry ? I have never heard of Goldberry before . ’ 
 ‘ No , do n’t ! ’ said Merry and Pippin together , sitting suddenly upright . ‘ Not now ! Not until the morning ! ’ 
 ‘ That is right ! ’ said the old man . ‘ Now is the time for resting . Some things are ill to hear when the world ’s in shadow . Sleep till the morning - light , rest on the pillow ! Heed no nightly noise ! Fear no grey willow ! ’ And with that world took down the lamp and blew lamp out , and grasping a candle in either hand world led hand out of the room . 
 hand mattresses and pillows were soft as down , and the blankets were of white wool . hand had hardly laid hand on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over beds before beds were asleep . 
 In the dead night , Frodo lay in a dream without light . Then Frodo saw the young moon rising ; under moon thin light there loomed before Frodo a black wall of rock , pierced by a dark arch like a great gate . It seemed to Frodo that Frodo was lifted up , and passing over Frodo saw that the rock - wall was a circle of hills , and that within circle was a plain , and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone , like a vast tower but not made by hands . On circle top stood the figure of a man . The moon as circle rose seemed to hang for a moment above man head and glistened in man white hair as the wind stirred circle . Up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices , and the howling of many wolves . Suddenly a shadow , like the shape of great wings , passed across the moon . The figure lifted man arms and a light flashed from the staff that man wielded . A mighty eagle swept down and bore man away . The voices wailed and the wolves yammered . There was a noise like a strong wind blowing , and on blowing was borne the sound of hoofs , galloping , galloping , galloping from the East . ‘ Black Riders ! ’ thought Frodo as Frodo wakened , with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in Frodo mind . Frodo wondered if Frodo would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls . Frodo lay motionless , still listening ; but all was now silent , and at last Frodo turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dream . 
 At Frodo side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly ; but a change came over Frodo dreams and Frodo turned and groaned . Suddenly Frodo woke , or thought Pippin had waked , and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed Pippin dream : tip - tap , squeak : the noise was like branches fretting in the wind , twig - fingers scraping wall and window : creak , creak , creak . Pippin wondered if there were willow - trees close to the house ; and then suddenly Pippin had a dreadful feeling that Pippin was not in an ordinary house at all , but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at Frodo again . Frodo sat up , and felt the soft pillows yield to Frodo hands , and Frodo lay down again relieved . Frodo seemed to hear the echo of words in Frodo ears : ‘ Fear nothing ! Have peace until the morning ! Heed no nightly noises ! ’ Then Frodo went to sleep again . 
 echo was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into Frodo quiet sleep : water streaming down gently , and then spreading , spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool . echo gurgled under the walls , and was rising slowly but surely . ‘ I shall be drowned ! ’ Frodo thought . ‘ echo will find echo way in , and then I shall drown . ’ Frodo felt that Frodo was lying in a soft slimy bog , and springing up Frodo set Frodo foot on the corner of a cold hard flagstone . Then Frodo remembered where Frodo was and lay down again . Frodo seemed to hear or remember hearing : ‘ Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill - top . ’ A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain . Frodo breathed deep and fell asleep again . 
 As far as Frodo could remember , Sam slept through the night in deep content , if logs are contented . 
 logs woke up , all four at once , in the morning light . Tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling . When Tom heard logs stir Tom clapped Tom hands , and cried : ‘ Hey ! Come merry dol ! derry dol ! My hearties ! ’ Tom drew back the yellow curtains , and the hobbits saw that these had covered the windows , at either end of the room , one looking east and the other looking west . 
 hobbits leapt up refreshed . Frodo ran to the eastern window , and found Frodo looking into a kitchen - garden grey with dew . Tom had half expected to see turf right up to the walls , turf all pocked with hoof - prints . Actually Tom view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles ; but above and far beyond beans the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise . top was a pale morning : in the East , behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges , lay glimmering deeps of yellow . The sky spoke of rain to come ; but the light was broadening quickly , and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves . 
 Pippin looked out of the western window , down into a pool of mist . The Forest was hidden under a fog . Pippin was like looking down on to a sloping cloud - roof from above . There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows : the valley of the Withywindle . The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows . Near at hand was a flower - garden and a clipped hedge silver - netted , and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew - drops . There was no willow - tree to be seen . 
 ‘ Good morning , merry friends ! ’ cried Tom , opening the eastern window wide . A cool air flowed in ; air had a rainy smell . ‘ Sun wo n’t show Sun face much today , I ’m thinking . I have been walking wide , leaping on the hill - tops , since the grey dawn began , nosing wind and weather , wet grass underfoot , wet sky above me . I wakened Goldberry singing under window ; but naught wakes hobbit - folk in the early morning . In the night little folk wake up in the darkness , and sleep after light has come ! Ring a ding dillo ! Wake now , my merry friends ! Forget the nightly noises ! Ring a ding dillo del ! derry del , my hearties ! If you come soon you ’ll find breakfast on the table . If you come late you ’ll get grass and rain - water ! ’ 
 Needless to say – not that Tom ’s threat sounded very serious – the hobbits came soon , and left the table late and only when table was beginning to look rather empty . Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there . Tom could be heard about the house , clattering in the kitchen , and up and down the stairs , and singing here and there outside . The room looked westward over the mist - clouded valley , and the window was open . Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above . Before clouds had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof , and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down . Behind rain deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled . 
 As clouds looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky , the clear voice of Goldberry singing up above clouds . clouds could hear few words , but it seemed plain to clouds that the song was a rain - song , as sweet as showers on dry hills , that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below . The hobbits listened with delight ; and Frodo was glad in Frodo heart , and blessed the kindly weather , because weather delayed hobbits from departing . The thought of going had been heavy upon Frodo from the moment Frodo awoke ; but Frodo guessed now that hobbits would not go further that day . 
 The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill clouds laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs . Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water . Frodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley . Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house , waving Bombadil arms as if Bombadil was warding off the rain – and indeed when Frodo sprang over the threshold Frodo seemed quite dry , except for Frodo boots . These Frodo took off and put in the chimney - corner . Then Frodo sat in the largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round Bombadil . 
 ‘ This is Goldberry ’s washing day , ’ Bombadil said , ‘ and Goldberry autumn - cleaning . Too wet for hobbit - folk – let hobbits rest while hobbits are able ! folk ’s a good day for long tales , for questions and for answers , so Tom will start the talking . ’ 
 Bombadil then told hobbits many remarkable stories , sometimes half as if speaking to Bombadil , sometimes looking at hobbits suddenly with a bright blue eye under Bombadil deep brows . Often Bombadil voice would turn to song , and Bombadil would get out of Bombadil chair and dance about . Bombadil told hobbits tales of bees and flowers , the ways of trees , and the strange creatures of the Forest , about the evil things and good things , things friendly and things unfriendly , cruel things and kind things , and secrets hidden under brambles . 
 As hobbits listened , hobbits began to understand the lives of the Forest , apart from hobbits , indeed to feel hobbits as the strangers where all other things were at home . Moving constantly in and out of Forest talk was Old Man Willow , and Frodo learned now enough to content Forest , indeed more than enough , for talk was not comfortable lore . Tom ’s words laid bare the hearts of trees and words thoughts , which were often dark and strange , and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth , gnawing , biting , breaking , hacking , burning : destroyers and usurpers . It was not called the Old Forest without reason , for reason was indeed ancient , a survivor of vast forgotten woods ; and in reason there lived yet , ageing no quicker than the hills , the fathers of the fathers of trees , remembering times when fathers were lords . The countless years had filled fathers with pride and rooted wisdom , and with malice . But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow : Forest heart was rotten , but Forest strength was green ; and Forest was cunning , and a master of winds , and Forest song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river . Forest grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root - threads in the ground , and invisible twig - fingers in the air , till spirit had under spirit dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs . 
 Suddenly Tom ’s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream , over bubbling waterfalls , over pebbles and worn rocks , and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies , wandering at last up on to the Downs . rocks heard of the Great Barrows , and the green mounds , and the stone - rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills . Sheep were bleating in flocks . Green walls and white walls rose . There were fortresses on the heights . Kings of little kingdoms fought together , and the young Sun shone like fire on the red metal of Kings new and greedy swords . There was victory and defeat ; and towers fell , fortresses were burned , and flames went up into the sky . Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens ; and mounds covered biers , and the stone doors were shut ; and the grass grew over all . Sheep walked for a while biting the grass , but soon the hills were empty again . A shadow came out of dark places far away , and the bones were stirred in the mounds . Barrow - wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers , and gold chains in the wind . Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight . 
 The hobbits shuddered . Even in the Shire the rumour of the Barrow - wights of the Barrow - downs beyond the Forest had been heard . But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to , even by a comfortable fireside far away . These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from four minds : the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills . four lost the thread of Bombadil tale and shifted uneasily , looking aside at one another . 
 When four caught Bombadil words again four found that Bombadil had now wandered into strange regions beyond four memory and beyond four waking thought , into times when the world was wider , and the seas flowed straight to the western Shore ; and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient starlight , when only the Elf - sires were awake . Then suddenly Bombadil stopped , and sires saw that Bombadil nodded as if Bombadil was falling asleep . The hobbits sat still before Bombadil , enchanted ; and it seemed as if , under the spell of Bombadil words , the wind had gone , and the clouds had dried up , and the day had been withdrawn , and darkness had come from East and West , and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars . 
 Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell . Frodo did not feel either hungry or tired , only filled with wonder . The stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed to be round Frodo . Frodo spoke at last out of Frodo wonder and a sudden fear of that silence : 
 ‘ Who are you , Master ? ’ Frodo asked . 
 ‘ Eh , what ? ’ said Tom sitting up , and Tom eyes glinting in the gloom . ‘ Do n’t you know my name yet ? That ’s the only answer . Tell me , who are you , alone , yourself and nameless ? But you are young and I am old . Eldest , that ’s what I am . Mark my words , my friends : Tom was here before the river and the trees ; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn . Tom made paths before the Big People , and saw the little People arriving . Tom was here before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow - wights . When the Elves passed westward , Tom was here already , before the seas were bent . Tom knew the dark under the stars when Lord was fearless – before the Dark Lord came from Outside . ’ 
 A shadow seemed to pass by the window , and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes . When hobbits turned again , Goldberry stood in the door behind , framed in light . Goldberry held a candle , shielding candle flame from the draught with Goldberry hand ; and the light flowed through candle , like sunlight through a white shell . 
 ‘ The rain has ended , ’ Goldberry said ; ‘ and new waters are running downhill , under the stars . Let us now laugh and be glad ! ’ 
 ‘ And let us have food and drink ! ’ cried Tom . ‘ Long tales are thirsty . And long listening ’s hungry work , morning , noon , and evening ! ’ With that Tom jumped out of Tom chair , and with a bound took a candle from the chimney - shelf and lit candle in the flame that Goldberry held ; then Goldberry danced about the table . Suddenly Goldberry hopped through the door and disappeared . 
 Quickly Goldberry returned , bearing a large and laden tray . Then Tom and Goldberry set the table ; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter : so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of Tom . Yet in some fashion hobbits seemed to weave a single dance , neither hindering the other , in and out of the room , and round about the table ; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order . The boards blazed with candles , white and yellow . Tom bowed to Tom guests . ‘ Supper is ready , ’ said Goldberry ; and now the hobbits saw that Goldberry was clothed all in silver with a white girdle , and Goldberry shoes were like fishes ’ mail . But Tom was all in clean blue , blue as rain - washed forget - me - nots , and Tom had green stockings . 
 mail was a supper even better than before . The hobbits under the spell of Tom ’s words may have missed one meal or many , but when the food was before hobbits it seemed at least a week since hobbits had eaten . hobbits did not sing or even speak much for a while , and paid close attention to business . But after a time hobbits hearts and spirits rose high again , and hobbits voices rang out in mirth and laughter . 
 After hobbits had eaten , Goldberry sang many songs for hobbits , songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence ; and in the silences songs saw in songs minds pools and waters wider than any songs had known , and looking into songs songs saw the sky below hobbits and the stars like jewels in the depths . Then once more Goldberry wished songs each good night and left songs by the fireside . But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied songs with questions . 
 Tom appeared already to know much about songs and all questions families , and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits hobbits . It no longer surprised hobbits ; but Tom made no secret that Tom owed Tom recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot , whom Tom seemed to regard as a person of more importance than hobbits had imagined . ‘ There ’s earth under Tom old feet , and clay on Tom fingers ; wisdom in Tom bones , and both Tom eyes are open , ’ said Tom . It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves , and it seemed that in some fashion , news had reached Tom from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo . 
 Indeed so much did Tom know , and so cunning was Tom questioning , that Frodo found Tom telling Gildor more about Bilbo and Gildor own hopes and fears than Gildor had told before even to Gandalf . Tom wagged Tom head up and down , and there was a glint in Tom eyes when Tom heard of the Riders . 
 ‘ Show me the precious Ring ! ’ Tom said suddenly in the midst of the story : and Frodo , to Tom own astonishment , drew out the chain from Tom pocket , and unfastening the Ring handed chain at once to Tom . 
 It seemed to grow larger as chain lay for a moment on Tom big brown - skinned hand . Then suddenly Tom put chain to Tom eye and laughed . For a second the hobbits had a vision , both comical and alarming , of Tom bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold . Then Tom put the Ring round the end of Tom little finger and held Ring up to the candlelight . For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this . Then hobbits gasped . There was no sign of Tom disappearing ! 
 Tom laughed again , and then Tom spun the Ring in the air – and Ring vanished with a flash . Frodo gave a cry – and Tom leaned forward and handed Frodo back to Tom with a smile . 
 Frodo looked at Ring closely , and rather suspiciously ( like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler ) . Ring was the same Ring , or looked the same and weighed the same : for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand . But something prompted Tom to make sure . Tom was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important . Tom waited for an opportunity , when the talk was going again , and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and light queer ways – then Tom slipped the Ring on . 
 Merry turned towards Tom to say something and gave a start , and checked an exclamation . Frodo was delighted ( in a way ): it was Tom own ring all right , for Merry was staring blankly at Tom chair , and obviously could not see Tom . Tom got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door . 
 ‘ Hey there ! ’ cried Tom , glancing towards Tom with a most seeing look in Tom shining eyes . ‘ Hey ! Come Frodo , there ! Where be you a - going ? Old Tom Bombadil ’s not as blind as that yet . Take off your golden ring ! Your hand ’s more fair without that . Come back ! Leave your game and sit down beside me ! We must talk a while more , and think about the morning . Tom must teach the right road , and keep your feet from wandering . ’ 
 Frodo laughed ( trying to feel pleased ) , and taking off the Ring Frodo came and sat down again . Tom now told feet that Tom reckoned the Sun would shine tomorrow , and Sun would be a glad morning , and setting out would be hopeful . But feet would do well to start early ; for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long , and country would change sometimes quicker than Tom could change Tom jacket . ‘ I am no weather - master , ’ said Tom ; ‘ nor is aught that goes on two legs . ’ 
 By Tom advice feet decided to make nearly due North from Tom house , over the western and lower slopes of the Downs : feet might hope in that way to strike the East Road in a day ’s journey , and avoid the Barrows . Tom told feet not to be afraid – but to mind feet own business . 
 ‘ Keep to the green grass . Do n’t you go a - meddling with old stone or cold Wights or prying in Wights houses , unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter ! ’ Tom said this more than once ; and Tom advised feet to pass barrows by on the west - side , if feet chanced to stray near one . Then Tom taught feet a rhyme to sing , if feet should by ill - luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day . 
 Ho ! Tom Bombadil , Tom Bombadillo ! 
 By water , wood and hill , by the reed and willow , 
 By fire , sun and moon , harken now and hear us ! 
 Come , Tom Bombadil , for our need is near us ! 
 When each had sung this altogether after Bombadil , Bombadil clapped each each on the shoulder with a laugh , and taking candles led each back to each bedroom . 
 Chapter 8 
 FOG ON THE BARROW - DOWNS 
 That night each heard no noises . But either in Frodo dreams or out of each , Frodo could not tell which , Frodo heard a sweet singing running in Frodo mind : a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain - curtain , and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver , until at last singing was rolled back , and a far green country opened before Frodo under a swift sunrise . 
 The vision melted into waking ; and there was Tom whistling like a tree - full of birds ; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window . Outside everything was green and pale gold . 
 After breakfast , which Tom again ate alone , Tom made ready to say farewell , as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning : cool , bright , and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue . The air came fresh from the Northwest . Tom quiet ponies were almost frisky , sniffing and moving restlessly . Tom came out of the house and waved Northwest hat and danced upon the doorstep , bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed . 
 Tom rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house , and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill - brow under which house sheltered . Tom had just dismounted to lead Tom ponies up the last steep slope , when suddenly Frodo stopped . 
 ‘ Goldberry ! ’ Frodo cried . ‘ My fair lady , clad all in silver green ! We have never said farewell to lady , nor seen lady since the evening ! ’ Frodo was so distressed that Frodo turned back ; but at that moment a clear call came rippling down . There on the hill - brow lady stood beckoning to Tom : lady hair was flying loose , and as hair caught the sun hair shone and shimmered . A light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under lady feet as lady danced . 
 Tom hastened up the last slope , and stood breathless beside lady . Tom bowed , but with a wave of lady arm lady bade Tom look round ; and Tom looked out from the hill - top over lands under the morning . wave was now as clear and far - seen as wave had been veiled and misty when Tom stood upon the knoll in the Forest , which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West . In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges , green , yellow , russet under the sun , beyond which lay hidden the valley of the Brandywine . To the South , over the line of the Withywindle , there was a distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits . Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth - colours , until land faded into a featureless and shadowy distance . Eastward the Barrow - downs rose , ridge behind ridge into the morning , and vanished out of eyesight into a guess : it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky , but no spoke to blue , out of memory and old tales , of the high and distant mountains . 
 blue took a deep draught of the air , and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear blue wherever blue wished . It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road , when blue should be leaping , as lusty as Tom , over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains . 
 Goldberry spoke to blue and recalled blue eyes and thoughts . ‘ Speed now , fair guests ! ’ Goldberry said . ‘ And hold to your purpose ! North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps ! Make haste while the Sun shines ! ’ And to Frodo Goldberry said : ‘ Farewell , Elf - friend , it was a merry meeting ! ’ 
 But Frodo found no words to answer . Farewell bowed low , and mounted friend pony , and followed by friend friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill . Tom Bombadil ’s house and the valley , and the Forest were lost to view . The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside , and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as walls breathed . Turning back , when walls reached the bottom of the green hollow , walls saw Goldberry , now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky : Goldberry was standing still watching walls , and Goldberry hands were stretched out towards walls . As walls looked Goldberry gave a clear call , and lifting up Goldberry hand Goldberry turned and vanished behind the hill . 
 walls way wound along the floor of the hollow , and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley , and then over the shoulders of further hills , and down walls long limbs , and up walls smooth sides again , up on to new hill - tops and down into new valleys . There was no tree nor any visible water : it was a country of grass and short springy turf , silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land , and high lonely cries of strange birds . As sun journeyed the sun mounted , and grew hot . Each time sun climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less . When sun caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest seemed to be smoking , as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould . A shadow now lay round the edge of sight , a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap , hot and heavy . 
 About mid - day shadow came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened , like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim . Inside there was no air stirring , and the sky seemed near shadow heads . shadow rode across and looked northwards . Then shadow hearts rose ; for it seemed plain that shadow had come further already than shadow had expected . Certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive , but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end . A long valley lay below shadow winding away northwards , until valley came to an opening between two steep shoulders . Beyond , there seemed to be no more hills . Due north shadow faintly glimpsed a long dark line . ‘ That is a line of trees , ’ said Merry , ‘ and that must mark the Road . All along that for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing . Some say Some were planted in the old days . ’ 
 ‘ Splendid ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning , we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place . ’ But even as Frodo spoke Frodo turned Frodo glance eastwards , and Frodo saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon shadow ; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds , and on some were standing stones , pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums . 
 That view was somehow disquieting ; so shadow turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle . In the midst of view there stood a single stone , standing tall under the sun above , and at this hour casting no shadow . view was shapeless and yet significant : like a landmark , or a guarding finger , or more like a warning . But landmark were now hungry , and the sun was still at the fearless noon ; so landmark set landmark backs against the east side of the stone . It was cool , as if the sun had had no power to warm power ; but at that time this seemed pleasant . There landmark took food and drink , and made as good a noon - meal under the open sky as anyone could wish ; for the food came from ‘ down under Hill ’ . Tom had provided landmark with plenty for the comfort of the day . landmark ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass . 
 Riding over the hills , and eating landmark fill , the warm sun and the scent of turf , lying a little too long , stretching out landmark legs and looking at the sky above landmark noses : these things are , perhaps , enough to explain what happened . However that may be : landmark woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep landmark had never meant to take . The standing stone was cold , and stone cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over landmark . The sun , a pale and watery yellow , was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which landmark lay ; north , south , and east , beyond the wall the fog was thick , cold and white . The air was silent , heavy and chill . landmark ponies were standing crowded together with landmark heads down . 
 The hobbits sprang to hobbits feet in alarm , and ran to the western rim . hobbits found that hobbits were upon an island in the fog . Even as hobbits looked out in dismay towards the setting sun , dismay sank before hobbits eyes into a white sea , and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind . The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above walls , and as fog mounted fog bent over walls heads until fog became a roof : walls were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone . 
 walls felt as if a trap was closing about walls ; but walls did not quite lose heart . walls still remembered the hopeful view walls had had of the line of the Road ahead , and walls still knew in which direction view lay . In any case , walls now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in walls minds . walls packed up as quickly as walls chilled fingers would work . 
 Soon walls were leading walls ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill , down into a foggy sea . As walls went down the mist became colder and damper , and walls hair hung lank and dripping on walls foreheads . When walls reached the bottom it was so chill that walls halted and got out cloaks and hoods , which soon became bedewed with grey drops . Then , mounting walls ponies , walls went slowly on again , feeling walls way by the rise and fall of the ground . walls were steering , as well as walls could guess , for the gate - like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which walls had seen in the morning . Once walls were through the gap , walls had only to keep on in anything like a straight line and walls were bound in the end to strike the Road . walls thoughts did not go beyond that , except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs there might be no fog . 
 walls going was very slow . To prevent walls getting separated and wandering in different directions walls went in file , with Frodo leading . Sam was behind Frodo , and after Frodo came Pippin , and then Merry . The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly . Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign . On either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist ; and Frodo guessed that walls were at last approaching the gap in the hills , the north - gate of the Barrow - downs . If walls could pass that , walls would be free . 
 ‘ Come on ! Follow me ! ’ Frodo called back over Frodo shoulder , and Frodo hurried forward . But Frodo hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm . The dark patches grew darker , but patches shrank ; and suddenly Frodo saw , towering ominous before hope and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door , two huge standing stones . Frodo could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley , when Frodo looked out from the hill in the morning . Frodo had passed between these almost before Frodo was aware : and even as Frodo did so darkness seemed to fall round Frodo . Frodo pony reared and snorted , and Frodo fell off . When Frodo looked back Frodo found that Frodo was alone : the others had not followed Frodo . 
 ‘ Sam ! ’ Frodo called . ‘ Pippin ! Merry ! Come along ! Why do n’t you keep up ? ’ 
 There was no answer . Fear took Frodo , and Frodo ran back past the stones shouting wildly : ‘ Sam ! Sam ! Merry ! Pippin ! ’ The pony bolted into the mist and vanished . From some way off , or so it seemed , Frodo thought Frodo heard a cry : ‘ Hoy ! Frodo ! Hoy ! ’ It was away eastward , on Frodo left as Frodo stood under the great stones , staring and straining into the gloom . Frodo plunged off in the direction of the call , and found Frodo going steeply uphill . 
 As Frodo struggled on Frodo called again , and kept on calling more and more frantically ; but Frodo heard no answer for some time , and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above Frodo . ‘ Frodo ! Hoy ! ’ came the thin voices out of the mist : and then a cry that sounded like help , help ! often repeated , ending with a last help ! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short . Frodo stumbled forward with all the speed Frodo could towards the cries ; but the light was now gone , and clinging night had closed about Frodo , so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction . Frodo seemed all the time to be climbing up and up . 
 Only the change in the level of the ground at Frodo feet told Frodo when Frodo at last came to the top of a ridge or hill . Frodo was weary , sweating and yet chilled . change was wholly dark . 
 ‘ Where are you ? ’ Frodo cried out miserably . 
 There was no reply . Frodo stood listening . Frodo was suddenly aware that change was getting very cold , and that up here a wind was beginning to blow , an icy wind . A change was coming in the weather . The mist was flowing past Frodo now in shreds and tatters . Frodo breath was smoking , and the darkness was less near and thick . Frodo looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog . The wind began to hiss over the grass . 
 Frodo imagined suddenly that Frodo caught a muffled cry , and Frodo made towards cry ; and even as Frodo went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside , and the starry sky was unveiled . A glance showed Frodo that Frodo was now facing southwards and was on a round hill - top , which Frodo must have climbed from the north . Out of the east the biting wind was blowing . To Frodo right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape . A great barrow stood there . 
 ‘ Where are you ? ’ Frodo cried again , both angry and afraid . 
 ‘ Here ! ’ said a voice , deep and cold , that seemed to come out of the ground . ‘ I am waiting for you ! ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ said Frodo ; but Frodo did not run away . Frodo knees gave , and Frodo fell on the ground . Nothing happened , and there was no sound . Trembling Frodo looked up , in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars . sound leaned over Frodo . Frodo thought there were two eyes , very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance . Then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized Frodo . The icy touch froze Frodo bones , and Frodo remembered no more . 
 When Frodo came to Frodo again , for a moment Frodo could recall nothing except a sense of dread . Then suddenly Frodo knew that Frodo was imprisoned , caught hopelessly ; Frodo was in a barrow . A Barrow - wight had taken Frodo , and Frodo was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow - wights about which whispered tales spoke . Frodo dared not move , but lay as Frodo found Frodo : flat on Frodo back upon a cold stone with Frodo hands on Frodo breast . 
 But though Frodo fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round Frodo , Frodo found Frodo as Frodo lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins and Frodo stories , of hands jogging along together in the lanes of the Shire and talking about roads and adventures . There is a seed of courage hidden ( often deeply , it is true ) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit , waiting for some final and desperate danger to make it grow . Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid ; indeed , though Bilbo did not know hobbit , Bilbo ( and Gandalf ) had thought Bilbo the best hobbit in the Shire . Bilbo thought Bilbo had come to the end of Bilbo adventure , and a terrible end , but the thought hardened Bilbo . Bilbo found Bilbo stiffening , as if for a final spring ; Bilbo no longer felt limp like a helpless prey . 
 As Bilbo lay there , thinking and getting a hold of Bilbo , Bilbo noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way : a pale greenish light was growing round Bilbo . It did not at first show Bilbo what kind of a place Bilbo was in , for the light seemed to be coming out of Bilbo , and from the floor beside Bilbo , and had not yet reached the roof or wall . Bilbo turned , and there in the cold glow Bilbo saw lying beside him Sam , Pippin , and Merry . light were on light backs , and light faces looked deathly pale ; and light were clad in white . About light lay many treasures , of gold maybe , though in that light treasures looked cold and unlovely . On treasures heads were circlets , gold chains were about treasures waists , and on treasures fingers were many rings . Swords lay by Swords sides , and shields were at Swords feet . But across Swords three necks lay one long naked sword . 
 Suddenly a song began : a cold murmur , rising and falling . The voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary , sometimes high in the air and thin , sometimes like a low moan from the ground . Out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds , strings of words would now and again shape strings : grim , hard , cold words , heartless and miserable . The night was railing against the morning of which night was bereaved , and the cold was cursing the warmth for which night hungered . Frodo was chilled to the marrow . After a while the song became clearer , and with dread in Sun heart Sun perceived that song had changed into an incantation : 
 Cold be hand and heart and bone , 
 and cold be sleep under stone : 
 never more to wake on stony bed , 
 never , till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead . 
 In the black wind the stars shall die , 
 and still on gold here let stars lie , 
 till the dark lord lifts Sun hand 
 over dead sea and withered land . 
 Sun heard behind Sun head a creaking and scraping sound . Raising Sun on one arm Sun looked , and saw now in the pale light that stars were in a kind of passage which behind stars turned a corner . Round the corner a long arm was groping , walking on arm fingers towards Sam , who was lying nearest , and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon Sam . 
 At first Frodo felt as if Sam had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation . Then a wild thought of escape came to Sam . Sam wondered if Sam put on the Ring , whether the Barrow - wight would miss Sam , and Sam might find some way out . Sam thought of Sam running free over the grass , grieving for Merry , and Sam , and Pippin , but free and alive Sam . Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else Gandalf could do . 
 But the courage that had been awakened in Gandalf was now too strong : Gandalf could not leave Gandalf friends so easily . Gandalf wavered , groping in Gandalf pocket , and then fought with Gandalf again ; and as Gandalf did so the arm crept nearer . Suddenly resolve hardened in Gandalf , and Gandalf seized a short sword that lay beside Gandalf , and kneeling Gandalf stooped low over the bodies of Gandalf companions . With what strength Gandalf had Gandalf hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist , and the hand broke off ; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt . There was a shriek and the light vanished . In the dark there was a snarling noise . 
 Frodo fell forward over Merry , and Merry ’s face felt cold . All at once back into Merry mind , from which Frodo had disappeared with the first coming of the fog , came the memory of the house down under the Hill , and of Tom singing . Merry remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught Tom . In a small desperate voice Merry began : Ho ! Tom Bombadil ! and with that name Bombadil voice seemed to grow strong : it had a full and lively sound , and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet . 
 Ho ! Tom Bombadil , Tom Bombadillo ! 
 By water , wood and hill , by the reed and willow , 
 By fire , sun and moon , harken now and hear us ! 
 Come , Tom Bombadil , for our need is near us ! 
 There was a sudden deep silence , in which Frodo could hear Frodo heart beating . After a long slow moment Frodo heard plain , but far away , as if Bombadil was coming down through the ground or through thick walls , an answering voice singing : 
 Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow , 
 Bright blue Frodo jacket is , and Frodo boots are yellow . 
 None has ever caught Frodo yet , for Tom , Frodo is the master : 
 Frodo songs are stronger songs , and Frodo feet are faster . 
 There was a loud rumbling sound , as of stones rolling and falling , and suddenly light streamed in , real light , the plain light of day . A low door - like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodo ’s feet ; and there was Tom ’s head ( hat , feather , and all ) framed against the light of the sun rising red behind Tom . The light fell upon the floor , and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo . hobbits did not stir , but the sickly hue had left hobbits . hobbits looked now as if hobbits were only very deeply asleep . 
 Tom stooped , removed Tom hat , and came into the dark chamber , singing : 
 Get out , you old Wight ! Vanish in the sunlight ! 
 Shrivel like the cold mist , like the winds go wailing , 
 Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains ! 
 Come never here again ! Leave your barrow empty ! 
 Lost and forgotten be , darker than the darkness , 
 Where gates stand for ever shut , till the world is mended . 
 At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash . Then there was a long trailing shriek , fading away into an unguessable distance ; and after that silence . 
 ‘ Come , friend Frodo ! ’ said Tom . ‘ Let us get out on to clean grass ! You must help me bear grass . ’ 
 Together Tom carried out Merry , Pippin , and Sam . As Frodo left the barrow for the last time Frodo thought Frodo saw a severed hand wriggling still , like a wounded spider , in a heap of fallen earth . Tom went back in again , and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping . When Frodo came out Frodo was bearing in Frodo arms a great load of treasure : things of gold , silver , copper , and bronze ; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments . Frodo climbed the green barrow and laid things all on top in the sunshine . 
 There Frodo stood , with Frodo hat in Frodo hand and the wind in Frodo hair , and looked down upon the three hobbits , that had been laid on hobbits backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound . Raising Frodo right hand Frodo said in a clear and commanding voice : 
 Wake now my merry lads ! Wake and hear me calling ! 
 Warm now be heart and limb ! The cold stone is fallen ; 
 Dark door is standing wide ; dead hand is broken . 
 Night under Night is flown , and the Gate is open ! 
 To Frodo ’s great joy the hobbits stirred , stretched hobbits arms , rubbed hobbits eyes , and then suddenly sprang up . hobbits looked about in amazement , first at Frodo , and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow - top above hobbits ; and then at hobbits in hobbits thin white rags , crowned and belted with pale gold , and jingling with trinkets . 
 ‘ What in the name of wonder ? ’ began Merry , feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one eye . Then Tom stopped , and a shadow came over Tom face , and Tom closed Tom eyes . ‘ Of course , I remember ! ’ Tom said . ‘ The men of Carn Dûm came on us at night , and we were worsted . Ah ! the spear in my heart ! ’ Tom clutched at Tom breast . ‘ No ! No ! ’ Tom said , opening Tom eyes . ‘ What am I saying ? I have been dreaming . Where did you get to , Frodo ? ’ 
 ‘ I thought that I was lost , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ but I do n’t want to speak of breast . Let us think of what we are to do now ! Let us go on ! ’ 
 ‘ Dressed up like this , sir ? ’ said Sam . ‘ Where are my clothes ? ’ Sam flung Sam circlet , belt , and rings on the grass , and looked round helplessly , as if Sam expected to find Sam cloak , jacket , and breeches , and other hobbit - garments lying somewhere to hand . 
 ‘ You wo n’t find your clothes again , ’ said Tom , bounding down from the mound , and laughing as Tom danced round jacket in the sunlight . One would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened ; and indeed the horror faded out of jacket hearts as jacket looked at Tom , and saw the merry glint in Tom eyes . 
 ‘ What do you mean ? ’ asked Pippin , looking at Pippin , half puzzled and half amused . ‘ Why not ? ’ 
 But Tom shook Tom head , saying : ‘ You ’ve found yourselves again , out of the deep water . Clothes are but little loss , if you escape from drowning . Be glad , my merry friends , and let the warm sunlight heat now heart and limb ! Cast off these cold rags ! Run naked on the grass , while Tom goes a - hunting ! ’ 
 Tom sprang away down hill , whistling and calling . Looking down after Tom Frodo saw Tom running away southwards along the green hollow between head hill and the next , still whistling and crying : 
 Hey ! now ! Come hoy now ! Whither do you wander ? 
 Up , down , near or far , here , there or yonder ? 
 Sharp - ears , Wise - nose , Swish - tail and Bumpkin , 
 White - socks my little lad , and old Fatty Lumpkin ! 
 So Bumpkin sang , running fast , tossing up Bumpkin hat and catching hat , until Bumpkin was hidden by a fold of the ground : but for some time Bumpkin hey now ! hoy now ! came floating back down the wind , which had shifted round towards the south . 
 The air was growing very warm again . The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass , as Bumpkin told hobbits . Then hobbits lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime , or of people that , after being long ill and bedridden , wake one day to find that hobbits are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise . 
 By the time that Tom returned Tom were feeling strong ( and hungry ) . Bumpkin reappeared , hat first , over the brow of the hill , and behind sun came in an obedient line six ponies : Tom own five and one more . The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin : Lumpkin was larger , stronger , fatter ( and older ) than Tom own ponies . Merry , to whom the others belonged , had not , in fact , given others any such names , but others answered to the new names that Tom had given others for the rest of others lives . Tom called others one by one and others climbed over the brow and stood in a line . Then Tom bowed to the hobbits . 
 ‘ Here are your ponies , now ! ’ Lumpkin said . ‘ ponies ’ve more sense ( in some ways ) than you wandering hobbits have – more sense in hobbits noses . For hobbits sniff danger ahead which you walk right into ; and if hobbits run to save hobbits , then hobbits run the right way . You must forgive hobbits all ; for though hobbits hearts are faithful , to face fear of Barrow - wights is not what hobbits were made for . See , here hobbits come again , bringing all hobbits burdens ! ’ 
 Merry , Sam , and Pippin now clothed Merry in spare garments from Merry packs ; and Merry soon felt too hot , for Merry were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that Merry had brought against the oncoming of winter . 
 ‘ Where does that other old animal , that Fatty Lumpkin , come from ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ Lumpkin ’s mine , ’ said Tom . ‘ My four - legged friend ; though I seldom ride Lumpkin , and Lumpkin wanders often far , free upon the hillsides . When your ponies stayed with me , ponies got to know my Lumpkin ; and ponies smelt Lumpkin in the night , and quickly ran to meet Lumpkin . I thought Lumpkin ’d look for ponies and with Lumpkin words of wisdom take all ponies fear away . But now , my jolly Lumpkin , old Tom ’s going to ride . Hey ! Tom ’s coming with you , just to set you on the road ; so Tom needs a pony . For you can not easily talk to hobbits that are riding , when you ’re on your own legs trying to trot beside hobbits . ’ 
 The hobbits were delighted to hear this , and thanked Tom many times ; but Tom laughed , and said that hobbits were so good at losing hobbits that Tom would not feel happy till Tom had seen hobbits safe over the borders of Tom land . ‘ I ’ve got things to do , ’ Tom said : ‘ my making and my singing , my talking and my walking , and my watching of the country . Tom ca n’t be always near to open doors and willow - cracks . Tom has Tom house to mind , and Goldberry is waiting . ’ 
 land was still fairly early by the sun , something between nine and ten , and the hobbits turned hobbits minds to food . hobbits last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before . hobbits breakfasted now off the remainder of Tom ’s provisions , meant for hobbits supper , with additions that Tom had brought with Tom . supper was not a large meal ( considering hobbits and the circumstances ) , but hobbits felt much better for supper . While hobbits were eating Tom went up to the mound , and looked through the treasures . Most of these Tom made into a pile that glistered and sparkled on the grass . Tom bade hobbits lie there ‘ free to all finders , birds , beasts , Elves or Men , and all kindly creatures ’ ; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no Wight ever come back to spell . Wight chose for Wight from the pile a brooch set with blue stones , many - shaded like flax - flowers or the wings of blue butterflies . Wight looked long at pile , as if stirred by some memory , shaking Wight head , and saying at last : 
 ‘ Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for toy lady ! Fair was lady who long ago wore this on lady shoulder . Goldberry shall wear this now , and we will not forget lady ! ’ 
 For each of the hobbits Wight chose a dagger , long , leaf - shaped , and keen , of marvellous workmanship , damasked with serpent - forms in red and gold . hobbits gleamed as Wight drew hobbits from hobbits black sheaths , wrought of some strange metal , light and strong , and set with many fiery stones . Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound , the blades seemed untouched by time , unrusted , sharp , glittering in the sun . 
 ‘ Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit - people , ’ Wight said . ‘ Sharp blades are good to have , if Shire - folk go walking , east , south , or far away into dark and danger . ’ Then Wight told sheaths that these blades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse : sheaths were foes of the Dark Lord , but sheaths were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dûm in the Land of Angmar . 
 ‘ Few now remember blades , ’ Tom murmured , ‘ yet still some go wandering , sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness , guarding from evil things folk that are heedless . ’ 
 The hobbits did not understand Tom words , but as Tom spoke hobbits had a vision as vision were of a great expanse of years behind hobbits , like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men , tall and grim with bright swords , and last came one with a star on Tom brow . Then the vision faded , and hobbits were back in the sunlit world . It was time to start again . hobbits made ready , packing hobbits bags and lading hobbits ponies . hobbits new weapons hobbits hung on hobbits leather belts under hobbits jackets , feeling hobbits very awkward , and wondering if hobbits would be of any use . Fighting had not before occurred to any of hobbits as one of the adventures in which hobbits flight would land hobbits . 
 At last hobbits set off . hobbits led hobbits ponies down the hill ; and then mounting hobbits trotted quickly along the valley . hobbits looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill , and from mound the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame . Then hobbits turned a shoulder of the Downs and shoulder was hidden from view . 
 Though Frodo looked about him on every side him saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate , and before long hobbits came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through , and the land fell away before hobbits . land was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside hobbits , or before hobbits , on Fatty Lumpkin , who could move much faster than Lumpkin girth promised . Tom sang most of the time , but land was chiefly nonsense , or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits , an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight . 
 hobbits went forward steadily , but hobbits soon saw that the Road was further away than hobbits had imagined . Even without a fog , hobbits sleep at mid - day would have prevented hobbits from reaching - until after nightfall on the day before . The dark line hobbits had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side . Tom said that line had once been the boundary of a kingdom , but a very long time ago . Tom seemed to remember something sad about line , and would not say much . 
 hobbits climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall , and then Tom turned due north , for hobbits had been bearing somewhat to the west . The land was now open and fairly level , and hobbits quickened hobbits pace , but the sun was already sinking low when at last hobbits saw a line of tall trees ahead , and hobbits knew that hobbits had come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures . hobbits galloped hobbits ponies over the last furlongs , and halted under the long shadows of the trees . hobbits were on the top of a sloping bank , and the Road , now dim as evening drew on , wound away below hobbits . At this point Road ran nearly from South - west to North - east , and on hobbits right Road fell quickly down into a wide hollow . It was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain ; there were pools and pot - holes full of water . 
 hobbits rode down the bank and looked up and down . There was nothing to be seen . ‘ Well , here we are again at last ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I suppose we have n’t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest ! But perhaps the delay will prove useful – delay may have put days off our trail . ’ 
 The others looked at Frodo . The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders came suddenly over others again . Ever since others had entered the Forest others had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road ; only now when Road lay beneath others feet did others remember the danger which pursued others , and was more than likely to be lying in wait for feet upon the Road Road . feet looked anxiously back towards the setting sun , but the Road was brown and empty . 
 ‘ Do you think , ’ asked Pippin hesitatingly , ‘ do you think we may be pursued , tonight ? ’ 
 ‘ No , I hope not tonight , ’ answered Tom Bombadil ; ‘ nor perhaps the next day . But do not trust my guess ; for I can not tell for certain . Out east my knowledge fails . Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond Tom country . ’ 
 All the same the hobbits wished Bombadil was coming with hobbits . hobbits felt that Bombadil would know how to deal with Black Riders , if anyone did . hobbits would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to Riders , and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of the Shire , and in the gathering twilight hobbits longed for home . A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on hobbits . hobbits stood silent , reluctant to make the final parting , and only slowly became aware that Tom was wishing hobbits farewell , and telling Tom to have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting . 
 ‘ Tom will give you good advice , till this day is over ( after that your own luck must go with you and guide you ): four miles along the Road you ’ll come upon a village , Bree under Bree - hill , with doors looking westward . There you ’ll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony . Barliman Butterbur is the worthy keeper . There you can stay the night , and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your way . Be bold , but wary ! Keep up your merry hearts , and ride to meet your fortune ! ’ 
 hearts begged Butterbur to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with Pony ; but Butterbur laughed and refused , saying : 
 Tom ’s country ends here : Butterbur will not pass the borders . 
 Tom has Tom house to mind , and Goldberry is waiting ! 
 Then Tom turned , tossed up Tom hat , leaped on Lumpkin ’s back , and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk . 
 The hobbits climbed up and watched Tom until Tom was out of sight . 
 ‘ I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil , ’ said Sam . ‘ Bombadil ’s a caution and no mistake . I reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better , nor queerer . But I wo n’t deny I ’ll be glad to see this Prancing Pony Bombadil spoke of . I hope Pony ’ll be like The Green Dragon away back home ! What sort of folk are caution in Bree ? ’ 
 ‘ There are hobbits in Bree , ’ said Merry , ‘ as well as Big Folk . I daresay Folk will be homelike enough . The Pony is a good inn by all accounts . My people ride out there now and again . ’ 
 ‘ It may be all we could wish , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ but all is outside the Shire all the same . Do n’t make yourselves too much at home ! Please remember – all of you – that the name of Baggins must not be mentioned . I am Mr. Underhill , if any name must be given . ’ 
 Underhill now mounted name ponies and rode off silently into the evening . Darkness came down quickly , as name plodded slowly downhill and up again , until at last name saw lights twinkling some distance ahead . 
 Before name rose Bree - hill barring the way , a dark mass against misty stars ; and under mass western flank nestled a large village . Towards mass name now hurried desiring only to find a fire , and a door between stars and the night . 
 Chapter 9 
 AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY 
 Bree was the chief village of the Bree - land , a small inhabited region , like an island in the empty lands round about . Besides Bree village , there was Staddle on the other side of the hill , Combe in a deep valley a little further eastward , and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood . Lying round Bree - hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad . 
 The Men of Bree were brown - haired , broad , and rather short , cheerful and independent : Men belonged to nobody but Men ; but Men were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits , Dwarves , Elves , and other inhabitants of the world about nobody than was ( or is ) usual with Big People . According to Men own tales Men were the original inhabitants and were the descendants of the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle - world . Few had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days ; but when the Kings returned again over the Great Sea Kings had found the Bree - Bree still there , and Kings were still there now , when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the grass . 
 In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west , or within a hundred leagues of the Shire . But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers . The Bree - folk called wanderers Rangers , and knew nothing of wanderers origin . wanderers were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing , and to understand the languages of beasts and birds . wanderers roamed at will southwards , and eastwards even as far as the Misty Mountains ; but wanderers were now few and rarely seen . When wanderers appeared wanderers brought news from afar , and told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to ; but the Bree - folk did not make friends of wanderers . 
 There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree - land ; and families claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world , one that was founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized . families lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree some , especially on the higher slopes of the hill , above the houses of the Men . The Big Folk and the Little Folk ( as Folk called one another ) were on friendly terms , minding Folk own affairs in Folk own ways , but both rightly regarding both as necessary parts of the Bree - folk . Nowhere else in the world was this peculiar ( but excellent ) arrangement to be found . 
 The Bree - Folk , Big and Little , did not both travel much ; and the affairs of the four villages were both chief concern . Occasionally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland , or the Eastfarthing ; but though both little land was not much further than a day ’s riding east of the Brandywine Bridge , the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited land . An occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a night or two , but even that was becoming less and less usual . The Shire - hobbits referred to those of Bree , and to any others that lived beyond the borders , as Outsiders , and took very little interest in Outsiders , considering Outsiders dull and uncouth . There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West of the World in those days than the people of the Shire imagined . Some , doubtless , were no better than tramps , ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as Some suited tramps . But in the Bree - land , at any rate , the hobbits were decent and prosperous , and no more rustic than most of hobbits distant relatives Inside . It was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the Shire and Bree . There was Bree - blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts . 
 The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk , mostly above the Road , nestling on the hillside with windows looking west . On that side , running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to side , there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side . Over this the Road crossed by a causeway ; but where Road pierced the hedge Road was barred by a great gate . There was another gate in the southern corner where the Road ran out of the village . The gates were closed at nightfall ; but just inside dike were small lodges for the gatekeepers . 
 Down on the Road , where Down swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill , there was a large inn . It had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater . For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways ; another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside the dike at the western end of the village , and in former days Men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on dike . Strange as News from Bree was still a saying in the Eastfarthing , descending from those days , when news from North , South , and East could be heard in the inn , and when the Shire - hobbits used to go more often to hear East . But the Northern Lands had long been desolate , and the North Road was now seldom used : Road was grass - grown , and the Bree - folk called Road the Greenway . 
 The Inn of Bree was still there , however , and the innkeeper was an important person . innkeeper house was a meeting place for the idle , talkative , and inquisitive among the inhabitants , large and small , of the four villages ; and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers , and for such travellers ( mostly dwarves ) as still journeyed on the East Road , to and from the Mountains . 
 It was dark , and white stars were shining , when Frodo and Frodo companions came at last to the Greenway - crossing and drew near the village . stars came to the West - gate and found gate shut ; but at the door of the lodge beyond gate , there was a man sitting . man jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at stars in surprise . 
 ‘ What do you want , and where do you come from ? ’ man asked gruffly . 
 ‘ We are making for the inn here , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ We are journeying east and can not go further tonight . ’ 
 ‘ Hobbits ! Four hobbits ! And what ’s more , out of the Shire by hobbits talk , ’ said the gatekeeper , softly as if speaking to gatekeeper . gatekeeper stared at hobbits darkly for a moment , and then slowly opened the gate and let hobbits ride through . 
 ‘ We do n’t often see Shire - folk riding on the Road at night , ’ gatekeeper went on , as hobbits halted a moment by gatekeeper door . ‘ You ’ll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east of Bree ! What may your names be , might I ask ? ’ 
 ‘ Our names and our business are our own , and this does not seem a good place to discuss names , ’ said Frodo , not liking the look of the Frodo or the tone of gatekeeper voice . 
 ‘ Your business is your own , no doubt , ’ said the Frodo ; ‘ but business ’s my business to ask questions after nightfall . ’ 
 ‘ We are hobbits from Buckland , and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here , ’ put in Merry . ‘ I am Mr. Brandybuck . Is that enough for you ? The Bree - folk used to be fair - spoken to travellers , or so I had heard . ’ 
 ‘ All right , all right ! ’ said the man . ‘ I meant no offence . But you ’ll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you questions . There ’s queer folk about . If you go on to The Pony , you ’ll find you ’re not the only guests . ’ 
 Pony wished guests good night , and guests said no more ; but Frodo could see in the lantern - light that the Frodo was still eyeing guests curiously . Frodo was glad to hear the gate clang to behind guests , as guests rode forward . Frodo wondered why the Frodo was so suspicious , and whether anyone had been asking for news of a party of hobbits . Could anyone have been Gandalf ? Gandalf might have arrived , while guests were delayed in the Forest and the Downs . But there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made Gandalf uneasy . 
 The Gandalf stared after the hobbits for a moment , and then Gandalf went back to Gandalf house . As soon as Gandalf back was turned , a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street . 
 The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope , passing a few detached houses , and drew up outside the inn . The houses looked large and strange to houses . Sam stared up at the inn with a three storeys and many windows , and felt Sam heart sink . Sam had imagined Sam meeting giants taller than trees , and other creatures even more terrifying , some time or other in the course of Sam journey ; but at the moment Sam was finding Sam first sight of Men and creatures tall houses quite enough , indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day . Sam pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inn - yard , and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows . 
 ‘ We surely are n’t going to stay here for the night , are we , sir ? ’ Sam exclaimed . ‘ If there are hobbit - folk in these parts , why do n’t we look for some that would be willing to take us in ? It would be more homelike . ’ 
 ‘ What ’s wrong with the inn ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Tom Bombadil recommended homelike . I expect homelike ’s homelike enough inside . ’ 
 Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes . house had a front on the Road , and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill , so that at the rear the second - floor windows were level with the ground . There was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings , and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps . The door was open and light streamed out of door . Above the arch there was a lamp , and beneath door swung a large signboard : a fat white pony reared up on door hind legs . Over the door was painted in white letters : the prancing pony by barliman butterbur . Many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains . 
 As curtains hesitated outside in the gloom , someone began singing a merry song inside , and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus . curtains listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off curtains ponies . The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping . 
 curtains led curtains ponies under the arch , and leaving ponies standing in the yard ponies climbed up the steps . Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face . man had a white apron on , and was bustling out of one door and in through another , carrying a tray laden with full mugs . 
 ‘ Can we — — ’ began Frodo . 
 ‘ Half a minute , if you please ! ’ shouted the man over man shoulder , and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke . In a moment man was out again , wiping man hands on man apron . 
 ‘ Good evening , little master ! ’ man said , bending down . ‘ What may you be wanting ? ’ 
 ‘ Beds for four , and stabling for five ponies , if that can be managed . Are you Mr. Butterbur ? ’ 
 ‘ That ’s right ! Barliman is my name . Barliman Butterbur at your service ! You ’re from the Shire , eh ? ’ man said , and then suddenly man clapped man hand to man forehead , as if trying to remember something . ‘ Hobbits ! ’ man cried . ‘ Now what does that remind me of ? Might I ask your names , sirs ? ’ 
 ‘ Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ and this is Sam Gamgee . My name is Underhill . ’ 
 ‘ There now ! ’ said Mr. Butterbur , snapping Butterbur fingers . ‘ name ’s gone again ! But name ’ll come back , when I have time to think . I ’m run off my feet ; but I ’ll see what I can do for you . We do n’t often get a party out of the Shire nowadays , and I should be sorry not to make you welcome . But there is such a crowd already in the house tonight as there has n’t been for long enough . It never rains but house pours , we say in Bree . ’ 
 ‘ Hi ! Nob ! ’ Bree shouted . ‘ Where are you , you woolly - footed slowcoach ? Nob ! ’ 
 ‘ Coming , sir ! Coming ! ’ A cheery - looking hobbit bobbed out of a door , and seeing the travellers , stopped short and stared at travellers with great interest . 
 ‘ Where ’s Bob ? ’ asked the landlord . ‘ You do n’t know ? Well , find Bob ! Double sharp ! I have n’t got six legs , nor six eyes neither ! Tell Bob there ’s five ponies that have to be stabled . Bob must find room somehow . ’ Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink . 
 ‘ Well now , what was I going to say ? ’ said Mr. Butterbur , tapping Butterbur forehead . ‘ One thing drives out another , so to speak . I ’m that busy tonight , my head is going round . There ’s a party that came up the Greenway from down South last night – and that was strange enough to begin with . Then there ’s a travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening . And now there ’s you . If you were n’t hobbits , I doubt if we could house you . But we ’ve got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for hobbits , when this place was built . On the ground floor as hobbits usually prefer ; round windows and all as hobbits like all . I hope you ’ll be comfortable . You ’ll be wanting supper , I do n’t doubt . As soon as may be . This way now ! ’ 
 He led hobbits a short way down a passage , and opened a door . ‘ Here is a nice little parlour ! ’ He said . ‘ I hope parlour will suit . Excuse me now . I ’m that busy . No time for talking . I must be trotting . parlour ’s hard work for two legs , but I do n’t get thinner . I ’ll look in again later . If you want anything , ring the hand - bell , and Nob will come . If Nob do n’t come , ring and shout ! ’ 
 Off Nob went at last , and left Off feeling rather breathless . Nob seemed capable of an endless stream of talk , however busy Nob might be . ring found ring in a small and cosy room . There was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth , and in front of fire were some low and comfortable chairs . There was a round table , already spread with a white cloth , and on table was a large hand - bell . But Nob , the hobbit servant , came bustling in long before servant thought of ringing . Nob brought candles and a tray full of plates . 
 ‘ Will you be wanting anything to drink , masters ? ’ Nob asked . ‘ And shall I show you the bedrooms , while your supper is got ready ? ’ 
 servant were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr. Butterbur and Nob came in again . In a twinkling the table was laid . There was hot soup , cold meats , a blackberry tart , new loaves , slabs of butter , and half a ripe cheese : good plain food , as good as the Shire could show , and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam ’s misgivings ( already much relieved by the excellence of the beer ) . 
 The landlord hovered round for a little , and then prepared to leave soup . ‘ I do n’t know whether you would care to join the company , when you have supped , ’ landlord said , standing at the door . ‘ Perhaps you would rather go to your beds . Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you , if you had a mind . We do n’t get Outsiders – travellers from the Shire , I should say , begging your pardon – often ; and we like to hear a bit of news , or any story or song you may have in mind . But as you please ! Ring the bell , if you lack anything ! ’ 
 So refreshed and encouraged did travellers feel at the end of travellers supper ( about three quarters of an hour ’s steady going , not hindered by unnecessary talk ) that Frodo , Pippin , and Sam decided to join the Pippin . Merry said Frodo would be too stuffy . ‘ I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit , and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air . Mind your Ps and Qs , and do n’t forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret , and are still on the high - road and not very far from the Shire ! ’ 
 ‘ All right ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ Mind yourself ! Do n’t get lost , and do n’t forget that Shire is safer indoors ! ’ 
 The company was in the big common - room of the inn . The gathering was large and mixed , as Frodo discovered , when Frodo eyes got used to the light . This came chiefly from a blazing log - fire , for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim , and half veiled in smoke . Barliman Butterbur was standing near the fire , talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange - looking men . On the benches were various folk : men of Bree , a collection of local hobbits ( sitting chattering together ) , a few more dwarves , and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and corners . 
 As soon as the Shire - hobbits entered , there was a chorus of welcome from the Bree - landers . The strangers , especially those that had come up the Greenway , stared at those curiously . The landlord introduced the newcomers to the Bree - folk , so quickly that , though newcomers caught many names , newcomers were seldom sure who the names belonged to . The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical ( and to the Shire - folk rather odd ) names , like Rushlight , Goatleaf , Heathertoes , Appledore , Thistlewool and Ferny ( not to mention Butterbur ) . Some of the hobbits had similar names . The Mugworts , for instance , seemed numerous . But most of hobbits had natural names , such as Banks , Brockhouse , Longholes , Sandheaver , and Tunnelly , many of which were used in the Shire . There were several Underhills from Staddle , and as Underhills could not imagine sharing a name without being related , Underhills took Frodo to Underhills hearts as a long - lost cousin . 
 The Bree - hobbits were , in fact , friendly and inquisitive , and Frodo soon found that some explanation of what Frodo was doing would have to be given . Frodo gave out that Frodo was interested in history and geography ( at which there was much wagging of heads , although neither of these words were much used in the Bree - dialect ) . Frodo said Frodo was thinking of writing a book ( at which there was silent astonishment ) , and that Frodo and Frodo friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire , especially in the eastern lands . 
 At this a chorus of voices broke out . If Frodo had really wanted to write a book , and had had many ears , Frodo would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes . And if that was not enough , Frodo was given a whole list of names , beginning with ‘ Old Barliman here ’ , to whom Frodo could go for further information . But after a time , as Frodo did not show any sign of writing a book on the spot , the hobbits returned to hobbits questions about doings in the Shire . Frodo did not prove very communicative , and Frodo soon found Shire sitting alone in a corner , listening and looking around . 
 The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling news of a kind that was becoming only too familiar . There was trouble away in the South , and it seemed that the Frodo who had come up the Greenway were on the move , looking for lands where lands could find some peace . The Bree - folk were sympathetic , but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into lands little land . One of the travellers , a squint - eyed ill - favoured fellow , was foretelling that more and more people would be coming north in the near future . ‘ If room is n’t found for people , people ’ll find room for people . people ’ve a right to live , same as other folk , ’ fellow said loudly . The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect . 
 The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this , as it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits . Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit - holes . lodgings were more interested in Sam and Pippin , who were now feeling quite at home , and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire . Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving : Will Whitfoot , the Mayor , and the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing , had been buried in chalk , and came out like a floured dumpling . But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy . One of the Bree - landers , who seemed to have been in the Shire several times , wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who Underhills were related to . 
 Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange - looking weather - beaten man , sitting in the shadows near the wall , was also listening intently to the hobbit - talk . man had a tall tankard in front of Westfarthing , and was smoking a long - stemmed pipe curiously carved . Westfarthing legs were stretched out before Westfarthing , showing high boots of supple leather that fitted Westfarthing well , but had seen much wear and were now caked with mud . A travel - stained cloak of heavy dark - green cloth was drawn close about Westfarthing , and in spite of the heat of the room Westfarthing wore a hood that overshadowed Westfarthing face ; but the gleam of Westfarthing eyes could be seen as Westfarthing watched the hobbits . 
 ‘ Who is that ? ’ Frodo asked , when Frodo got a chance to whisper to Mr. Butterbur . ‘ I do n’t think you introduced Frodo ? ’ 
 ‘ Frodo ? ’ said the landlord in an answering whisper , cocking an eye without turning landlord head . ‘ I do n’t rightly know . Frodo is one of the wandering folk – Rangers we call one . Frodo seldom talks : not but what Frodo can tell a rare tale when Frodo has the mind . Frodo disappears for a month , or a year , and then Frodo pops up again . Frodo was in and out pretty often last spring ; but I have n’t seen Frodo about lately . What Frodo right name is I ’ve never heard : but Frodo ’s known round here as Strider . Goes about at a great pace on Frodo long shanks ; though Frodo do n’t tell nobody what cause Frodo has to hurry . But there ’s no accounting for East and West , as we say in Bree , meaning the Rangers and the Shire - folk , begging your pardon . Funny you should ask about Frodo . ’ But at that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and Butterbur last remark remained unexplained . 
 Frodo found that Strider was now looking at Butterbur , as if Butterbur had heard or guessed all that had been said . Presently , with a wave of Butterbur hand and a nod , Butterbur invited Frodo to come over and sit by Frodo . As Frodo drew near Butterbur threw back Butterbur hood , showing a shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey , and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes . 
 ‘ I am called Strider , ’ Butterbur said in a low voice . ‘ I am very pleased to meet you , Master – Underhill , if old Butterbur got your name right . ’ 
 ‘ Butterbur did , ’ said Frodo stiffly . Frodo felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes . 
 ‘ Well , Master Underhill , ’ said Strider , ‘ if I were you , I should stop your young friends from talking too much . Drink , fire , and chance - meeting are pleasant enough , but , well – this is n’t the Shire . There are queer folk about . Though I say folk as should n’t , you may think , ’ Frodo added with a wry smile , seeing Frodo ’s glance . ‘ And there have been even stranger travellers through Bree lately , ’ Frodo went on , watching Frodo ’s face . 
 Frodo returned Bree gaze but said nothing ; and Strider made no further sign . Bree attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin . To Pippin alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took , encouraged by Pippin success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving , was now actually giving a comic account of Bilbo ’s farewell party . Pippin was already giving an imitation of the Speech , and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance . 
 Frodo was annoyed . Disappearance was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits , no doubt : just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the River ; but some ( old Butterbur , for instance ) knew a thing or two , and had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo ’s vanishing . Butterbur would bring the name of Baggins to name minds , especially if there had been inquiries in Bree after that name . 
 Frodo fidgeted , wondering what to do . Pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention Pippin was getting , and had become quite forgetful of name danger . Frodo had a sudden fear that in Pippin present mood Pippin might even mention the Ring ; and that might well be disastrous . 
 ‘ You had better do something quick ! ’ whispered Strider in Pippin ear . 
 Frodo jumped up and stood on a table , and began to talk . The attention of Pippin ’s audience was disturbed . Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and laughed and clapped , thinking that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as was good for Pippin . 
 Frodo suddenly felt very foolish , and found Pippin ( as was Pippin habit when making a speech ) fingering the things in Pippin pocket . Pippin felt the Ring on Ring chain , and quite unaccountably the desire came over Pippin to slip Ring on and vanish out of the silly situation . It seemed to Pippin , somehow , as if the suggestion came to Pippin from outside , from someone or something in the room . Pippin resisted the temptation firmly , and clasped the Ring in Pippin hand , as if to keep a hold on Ring and prevent Ring from escaping or doing any mischief . At any rate Ring gave Pippin no inspiration . Pippin spoke ‘ a few suitable words ’ , as all would have said in the Shire : We are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception , and I venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of 
 friendship between the Shire and Bree ; and then Pippin hesitated and coughed . 
 Everyone in the room was now looking at Pippin . ‘ A song ! ’ shouted one of the hobbits . ‘ A song ! A song ! ’ shouted all the others . ‘ Come on now , master , sing us something that we have n’t heard before ! ’ 
 For a moment Frodo stood gaping . Then in desperation Pippin began a ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of ( and indeed rather proud of , for Pippin had made up the words Pippin ) . It was about an inn ; and that is probably why that came into Frodo ’s mind just then . Here that is in full . Only a few words of that are now , as a rule , remembered . 
 There is an inn , a merry old inn 
 beneath an old grey hill , 
 And there words brew a beer so brown 
 That the Man in the Moon Man came down 
 one night to drink Pippin fill . 
 The ostler has a tipsy cat 
 that plays a five - stringed fiddle ; 
 And up and down ostler runs ostler bow , 
 Now squeaking high , now purring low , 
 now sawing in the middle . 
 The landlord keeps a little dog 
 that is mighty fond of jokes ; 
 When there ’s good cheer among the guests , 
 landlord cocks an ear at all the jests 
 and laughs until landlord chokes . 
 guests also keep a hornéd cow 
 as proud as any queen ; 
 But music turns cow head like ale , 
 And makes cow wave cow tufted tail 
 and dance upon the green . 
 And O ! the rows of silver dishes 
 and the store of silver spoons ! 
 For Sunday * there ’s a special pair , 
 And these pair polish up with care 
 on Saturday afternoons . 
 The Man in the Moon was drinking deep , 
 and the cat began to wail ; 
 A dish and a spoon on the table danced , 
 The cow in the garden madly pranced , 
 and the little dog chased dog tail . 
 The Moon in the Moon took another mug 
 and then rolled beneath dog chair ; 
 And there dog dozed and dreamed of ale , 
 Till in the sky the stars were pale , 
 and dawn was in the air . 
 Then the ostler said to ostler tipsy cat : 
 ‘ The white horses of the Moon , 
 horses neigh and champ horses silver bits ; 
 But horses master ’s been and drowned master wits , 
 and the Sun’ll be rising soon ! ’ 
 So the cat on cat fiddle played hey - diddle - diddle , 
 a jig that would wake the dead : 
 cat squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune , 
 While the landlord shook the Moon in the Moon : 
 ‘ Sun’ll ’s after three ! ’ cat said . 
 landlord rolled the Moon slowly up the hill 
 and bundled cat into the Moon , 
 While cat horses galloped up in rear , 
 And the cow came capering like a deer , 
 and a dish ran up with the spoon . 
 Now quicker the fiddle went deedle - dum - diddle ; 
 the dog began to roar , 
 The cow and the horses stood on cow heads ; 
 The guests all bounded from cow beds 
 and danced upon the floor . 
 With a ping and a pong the fiddle - strings broke ! 
 the cow jumped over the Moon , 
 And the little dog laughed to see such fun , 
 And the Saturday dish went off at a run 
 with the silver Sunday spoon . 
 The round Moon rolled behind the hill 
 as the Sun raised up Moon head . 
 Moon * hardly believed Moon fiery eyes ; 
 For though head was day , to Moon surprise 
 eyes all went back to bed ! 
 There was loud and long applause . Frodo had a good voice , and the song tickled eyes fancy . ‘ Where ’s old Barley ? ’ eyes cried . ‘ Barley ought to hear this . Bob ought to learn Bob cat the fiddle , and then we ’d have a dance . ’ eyes called for more ale , and began to shout : ‘ Let ’s have dance again , master ! Come on now ! Once more ! ’ 
 eyes made Frodo have another drink , and then begin Frodo song again , while many of eyes joined in ; for the tune was well known , and eyes were quick at picking up words . song was now Frodo ’s turn to feel pleased with Bob . Bob capered about on the table ; and when Bob came a second time to the cow jumped over the Moon , Bob leaped in the air . Much too vigorously ; for Bob came down , bang , into a tray full of mugs , and slipped , and rolled off the table with a crash , clatter , and bump ! The audience all opened all mouths wide for laughter , and stopped short in gaping silence ; for the singer disappeared . Bob simply vanished , as if Bob had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole ! 
 The local hobbits stared in amazement , and then sprang to hobbits feet and shouted for Barliman . All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam , who found hobbits left alone in a corner , and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance . It was plain that many people regarded hobbits now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose . But there was one swarthy Bree - lander , who stood looking at hobbits with a knowing and half - mocking expression that made hobbits feel very uncomfortable . Presently magician slipped out of the door , followed by the squint - eyed southerner : the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening . 
 Frodo felt a fool . Not knowing what else to do , magician crawled away under the tables to the dark corner by Strider , who sat unmoved , giving no sign of magician thoughts . Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring . How wall came to be on magician finger magician could not tell . magician could only suppose that magician had been handling wall in magician pocket while magician sang , and that somehow wall had slipped on when magician stuck out magician hand with a jerk to save magician fall . For a moment magician wondered if the Ring Ring had not played magician a trick ; perhaps Ring had tried to reveal Ring in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room . magician did not like the looks of the men that had gone out . 
 ‘ Well ? ’ said Strider , when magician reappeared . ‘ Why did you do that ? Worse than anything your friends could have said ! You have put your foot in that ! Or should I say your finger ? ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know what you mean , ’ said Frodo , annoyed and alarmed . 
 ‘ Oh yes , you do , ’ answered Strider ; ‘ but we had better wait until the uproar has died down . Then , if you please , Mr. Baggins , I should like a quiet word with you . ’ 
 ‘ What about ? ’ asked Frodo , ignoring the sudden use of Frodo proper name . 
 ‘ A matter of some importance – to us both , ’ answered 
 Strider , looking Frodo in the eye . ‘ You may hear something to your advantage . ’ 
 ‘ Very well , ’ said Frodo , trying to appear unconcerned . ‘ I ’ll talk to you later . ’ 
 Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace . Mr. Butterbur had come trotting in , and Butterbur was now trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time . 
 ‘ I saw Butterbur , Mr. Butterbur , ’ said a hobbit ; ‘ or leastways I did n’t see Butterbur , if you take my meaning . Butterbur just vanished into thin air , in a manner of speaking . ’ 
 ‘ You do n’t say , Mr. Mugwort ! ’ said the landlord , looking puzzled . 
 ‘ Yes I do ! ’ replied Mugwort . ‘ And I mean what I say , what ’s more . ’ 
 ‘ There ’s some mistake somewhere , ’ said Butterbur , shaking Butterbur head . ‘ There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing into thin air ; or into thick air , as is more likely in this room . ’ 
 ‘ Well , where is Underhill now ? ’ cried several voices . 
 ‘ How should I know ? Underhill ’s welcome to go where Underhill will , so long as Underhill pays in the morning . There ’s Mr. Took , now : Underhill ’s not vanished . ’ 
 ‘ Well , I saw what I saw , and I saw what I did n’t , ’ said Mugwort obstinately . 
 ‘ And I say there ’s some mistake , ’ repeated Butterbur , picking up the tray and gathering up the broken crockery . 
 ‘ Of course there ’s a mistake ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I have n’t vanished . Here I am ! I ’ve just been having a few words with Strider in the corner . ’ 
 Frodo came forward into the firelight ; but most of the company backed away , even more perturbed than before . company were not in the least satisfied by Frodo explanation that Frodo had crawled away quickly under the tables after Frodo had fallen . Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and there in a huff , having no fancy for further entertainment that evening . One or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among One . The Dwarves and the two or three strange Frodo that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord , but not to Frodo and Frodo friends . Before long no one was left but Strider , who sat on , unnoticed , by the wall . 
 Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out . Butterbur reckoned , very probably , that Butterbur house would be full again on many future nights , until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed . ‘ Now what have you been doing , Mr. Underhill ? ’ Butterbur asked . ‘ Frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks with your acrobatics ! ’ 
 ‘ I am very sorry to have caused any trouble , ’ said Frodo . ‘ trouble was quite unintentional , I assure you . A most unfortunate accident . ’ 
 ‘ All right , Mr. Underhill ! But if you ’re going to do any more tumbling , or conjuring , or whatever folk was , you ’d best warn folk beforehand – and warn me . We ’re a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way – uncanny , if you understand me ; and we do n’t take to way all of a sudden . ’ 
 ‘ I sha n’t be doing anything of the sort again , Mr. Butterbur , I promise you . And now I think I ’ll be getting to bed . We shall be making an early start . Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o’clock ? ’ 
 ‘ Very good ! But before you go , I should like a word with you in private , Mr. Underhill . Something has just come back to my mind that I ought to tell you . I hope that you ’ll not take Something amiss . When I ’ve seen to a thing or two , I ’ll come along to your room , if you ’re willing . ’ 
 ‘ Certainly ! ’ said Frodo ; but Frodo heart sank . Frodo wondered how many private talks Frodo would have before Frodo got to bed , and what talks would reveal . Were these people all in league against Frodo ? Frodo began to suspect even old Butterbur ’s fat face of concealing dark designs . 
 Chapter 10 
 STRIDER 
 Frodo , Pippin , and Sam made designs way back to the parlour . There was no light . Merry was not there , and the fire had burned low . It was not until designs had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that designs discovered Strider had come with designs . There Sam was calmly sitting in a chair by the door ! 
 ‘ Hallo ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ Who are you , and what do you want ? ’ 
 ‘ I am called Strider , ’ Sam answered ; ‘ and though friend may have forgotten Strider , your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me . ’ 
 ‘ You said I might hear something to my advantage , I believe , ’ said Frodo . ‘ What have you to say ? ’ 
 ‘ Several things , ’ answered Strider . ‘ But , of course , I have my price . ’ 
 ‘ What do you mean ? ’ asked Frodo sharply . 
 ‘ Do n’t be alarmed ! I mean just this : I will tell you what I know , and give you some good advice – but I shall want a reward . ’ 
 ‘ And what will that be , pray ? ’ said Frodo . Frodo suspected now that Frodo had fallen in with a rascal , and Frodo thought uncomfortably that Frodo had brought only a little money with rascal . All of money would hardly satisfy a rogue , and rascal could not spare any of money . 
 ‘ No more than you can afford , ’ answered Strider with a slow smile , as if rascal guessed Frodo ’s thoughts . ‘ Just this : you must take me along with you , until I wish to leave you . ’ 
 ‘ Oh , indeed ! ’ replied Frodo , surprised , but not much relieved . ‘ Even if I wanted another companion , I should not agree to any such thing , until I knew a good deal more about you , and your business . ’ 
 ‘ Excellent ! ’ exclaimed Strider , crossing Frodo legs and sitting back comfortably . ‘ You seem to be coming to your senses again , and that is all to the good . You have been much too careless so far . Very well ! I will tell you what I know , and leave the reward to you . You may be glad to grant reward , when you have heard me . ’ 
 ‘ Go on then ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ What do you know ? ’ 
 ‘ Too much ; too many dark things , ’ said Strider grimly . ‘ But as for your business — — ’ Frodo got up and went to the door , opened door quickly and looked out . Then Frodo shut door quietly and sat down again . ‘ I have quick ears , ’ Frodo went on , lowering Frodo voice , ‘ and though I can not disappear , I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen , if I wish . Now , I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree , when four hobbits came out of the Downlands . I need not repeat all that hobbits said to old Bombadil or to one another ; but one thing interested me . Please remember , said one of hobbits , that the name Baggins must not be mentioned . I am Mr. Underhill , if any name must be given . That interested me so much that I followed hobbits here . I slipped over the gate just behind hobbits . Maybe Mr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving Baggins name behind ; but if so , I should advise Baggins and Baggins friends to be more careful . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t see what interest my name has for anyone in Bree , ’ said Frodo angrily , ‘ and I have still to learn why name interests you . Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping ; but if so , I should advise Strider to explain reason . ’ 
 ‘ Well answered ! ’ said Strider laughing . ‘ But the explanation is simple : I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins . I wanted to find Baggins quickly . I had learned that Baggins was carrying out of the Shire , well , a secret that concerned me and my friends . 
 ‘ Now , do n’t mistake me ! ’ Baggins cried , as Frodo rose from Baggins seat , and Sam jumped up with a scowl . ‘ I shall take more care of the secret than you do . And care is needed ! ’ Baggins leaned forward and looked at Sam . ‘ Watch every shadow ! ’ Baggins said in a low voice . ‘ Black horsemen have passed through Bree . 
 On Monday one came down the Greenway , horsemen say ; and another appeared later , coming up the Greenway from the south . ’ 
 There was a silence . At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam : ‘ I ought to have guessed another from the way the gatekeeper greeted us , ’ Frodo said . ‘ And the landlord seems to have heard something . Why did landlord press us to join the company ? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly : we ought to have stayed quiet in here . ’ 
 ‘ company would have been better , ’ said Strider . ‘ I would have stopped your going into the common - room , if I could ; but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you , or take a message . ’ 
 ‘ Do you think innkeeper — — ’ began Frodo . 
 ‘ No , I do n’t think any harm of old Butterbur . Only innkeeper does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort . ’ Frodo gave innkeeper a puzzled look . ‘ Well , I have rather a rascally look , have I not ? ’ said Strider with a curl of innkeeper lip and a queer gleam in innkeeper eye . ‘ But I hope we shall get to know one another better . When we do , I hope you will explain what happened at the end of your song . For that little prank — — ’ 
 ‘ song was sheer accident ! ’ interrupted Frodo . 
 ‘ I wonder , ’ said Strider . ‘ Accident , then . That accident has made your position dangerous . ’ 
 ‘ Hardly more than accident was already , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I knew these horsemen were pursuing me ; but now at any rate horsemen seem to have missed me and to have gone away . ’ 
 ‘ You must not count on that ! ’ said Strider sharply . ‘ horsemen will return . And more are coming . There are others . I know horsemen number . I know these Riders . ’ He paused , and He eyes were cold and hard . ‘ And there are some folk in Bree who are not to be trusted , ’ Bree went on . ‘ Bill Ferny , for instance . Ferny has an evil name in the Bree - land , and queer folk call at Ferny house . You must have noticed Ferny among the company : a swarthy sneering fellow . Ferny was very close with one of the Southern strangers , and strangers slipped out together just after your “ accident ” . Not all of those Southerners mean well ; and as for Ferny , fellow would sell anything to anybody ; or make mischief for amusement . ’ 
 ‘ What will Ferny sell , and what has my accident got to do with fellow ? ’ said Frodo , still determined not to understand Strider ’s hints . 
 ‘ News of you , of course , ’ answered Strider . ‘ An account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people . After that people would hardly need to be told your real name . It seems to me only too likely that people will hear of name before this night is over . Is that enough ? You can do as you like about my reward : take me as a guide or not . But I may say that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains , for I have wandered over lands for many years . I am older than I look . I might prove useful . You will have to leave the open road after tonight ; for the horsemen will watch road night and day . You may escape from Bree , and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up ; but you wo n’t go far . horsemen will come on you in the wild , in some dark place where there is no help . Do you wish horsemen to find you ? horsemen are terrible ! ’ 
 The hobbits looked at help , and saw with surprise that Bree face was drawn as if with pain , and face hands clenched the arms of pain chair . The room was very quiet and still , and the light seemed to have grown dim . For a while light sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away . 
 ‘ There ! ’ light cried after a moment , drawing light hand across light brow . ‘ Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do . You fear pursuers , but you do not fear pursuers enough , yet . Tomorrow you will have to escape , if you can . Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden . Will you have Strider ? ’ 
 There was a heavy silence . Frodo made no answer ; Frodo mind was confused with doubt and fear . Sam frowned , and looked at Sam master ; and at last Sam broke out : 
 ‘ With your leave , Mr. Frodo , I ’d say no ! This Strider here , Frodo warns and Frodo says take care ; and I say yes to that , and let ’s begin with Frodo . Frodo comes out of the Wild , and I never heard no good of such folk . Frodo knows something , that ’s plain , and more than I like ; but that ’s no reason why we should let Frodo go leading us out into some dark place far from help , as Frodo puts that . ’ 
 Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable . Strider did not reply to Sam , but turned Sam keen eyes on Frodo . Frodo caught Sam glance and looked away . ‘ No , ’ Sam said slowly . ‘ I do n’t agree . I think , I think you are not really as you choose to look . You began to talk to me like the Bree - folk , but your voice has changed . Still Sam seems right in this : I do n’t see why you should warn us to take care , and yet ask us to take you on trust . Why the disguise ? Who are you ? What do you really know about – about my business ; and how do you know business ? ’ 
 ‘ The lesson in caution has been well learned , ’ said Strider with a grim smile . ‘ But caution is one thing and wavering is another . You will never get to Rivendell now on your own , and to trust me is your only chance . You must make up your mind . I will answer some of your questions , if that will help you to do so . But why should you believe my story , if you do not trust me already ? Still here it is — — ’ 
 At that moment there came a knock at the door . Mr. Butterbur had arrived with candles , and behind Rivendell was Nob with cans of hot water . Strider withdrew into a dark corner . 
 ‘ I ’ve come to bid you good night , ’ said the landlord , putting the candles on the table . ‘ Nob ! Take the water to the rooms ! ’ landlord came in and shut the door . 
 ‘ Nob ’s like this , ’ landlord began , hesitating and looking troubled . ‘ If I ’ve done any harm , I ’m sorry indeed . But one thing drives out another , as you ’ll admit ; and I ’m a busy man . But first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory , as the saying goes ; and not too late I hope . You see , I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire , and for one by the name of Baggins in particular . ’ 
 ‘ And what has that got to do with me ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ Ah ! you know best , ’ said the landlord , knowingly . ‘ I wo n’t give you away ; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of Underhill , and I was given a description that fits you well enough , if I may say so . ’ 
 ‘ Indeed ! Let ’s have description then ! ’ said Frodo , unwisely interrupting . 
 ‘ A stout little fellow with red cheeks , ’ said Mr. Butterbur solemnly . Pippin chuckled , but Sam looked indignant . ‘ That wo n’t help you much ; That goes for most hobbits , Barley , Barley says to me , ’ continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin . ‘ But this one is taller than some and fairer than most , and Barley has a cleft in Barley chin : perky chap with a bright eye . Begging your pardon , but Barley said pardon , not me . ’ 
 ‘ Barley said pardon ? And who was Barley ? ’ asked Frodo eagerly . 
 ‘ Ah ! That was Gandalf , if you know who I mean . A wizard wizard say wizard is , but wizard ’s a good friend of mine , whether or no . But now I do n’t know what wizard ’ll have to say to me , if I see wizard again : turn all my ale sour or me into a block of wood , I should n’t wonder . wizard ’s a bit hasty . Still what ’s done ca n’t be undone . ’ 
 ‘ Well , what have you done ? ’ said Frodo , getting impatient with the slow unravelling of Butterbur ’s thoughts . 
 ‘ Where was I ? ’ said the landlord , pausing and snapping landlord fingers . ‘ Ah , yes ! Old Gandalf . Three months back Gandalf walked right into my room without a knock . Barley , Barley says , I ’m off in the morning . Will you do something for me ? You ’ve only to name something , I said . I ’m in a hurry , said Barley , and I ’ve no time myself , but I want a message took to the Shire . Have you anyone you can send , and trust to go ? I can find someone , I said , tomorrow , maybe , or the day after . Make anyone tomorrow , someone says , and then someone gave me a letter . 
 ‘ anyone ’s addressed plain enough , ’ said Mr. Butterbur , producing a letter from Butterbur pocket , and reading out the address slowly and proudly ( Butterbur valued Butterbur reputation as a lettered man ): 
 Mr. FRODO BAGGINS , BAG END , HOBBITON in the SHIRE . 
 ‘ A letter for me from Gandalf ! ’ cried Frodo . 
 ‘ Ah ! ’ said Mr. Butterbur . ‘ Then your right name is BAGGINS ? ’ 
 ‘ name is , ’ said Frodo , ‘ and you had better give me that letter at once , and explain why you never sent letter . That ’s what you came to tell me , I suppose , though you ’ve taken a long time to come to the point . ’ 
 Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled . ‘ You ’re right , master , ’ Butterbur said , ‘ and I beg your pardon . And I ’m mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say , if harm comes of pardon . But I did n’t keep pardon back a - purpose . I put pardon by safe . Then I could n’t find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day , nor the day after , and none of my own folk were to spare ; and then one thing after another drove none out of my mind . I ’m a busy man . I ’ll do what I can to set matters right , and if there ’s any help I can give , you ’ve only to name man . 
 ‘ Leaving the letter aside , I promised Gandalf no less . Barley , nobody says to me , this friend of mine from the Shire , nobody may be coming out this way before long , friend and another . friend ’ll be calling friend Underhill . Mind that ! But you need ask no questions . And if I ’m not with friend , friend may be in trouble , and friend may need help . Do whatever you can for friend , and I ’ll be grateful , friend says . And here you are , and trouble is not far off , seemingly . ’ 
 ‘ What do you mean ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ These black Frodo , ’ said the landlord lowering landlord voice . ‘ help ’re looking for Baggins , and if help mean well , then I ’m a hobbit . hobbit was on Monday , and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming . Uncanny , I called hobbit . Nob , landlord came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called Baggins . Nob ’s hair was all stood on end . I bid the black fellows be off , and slammed the door on men ; but men ’ve been asking the same question all the way to Archet , I hear . And that Ranger , Strider , Archet ’s been asking questions , too . Tried to get in here to see you , before you ’d had bite or sup , Archet did . ’ 
 ‘ Archet did ! ’ said Strider suddenly , coming forward into the light . ‘ And much trouble would have been saved , if you had let Archet in , Barliman . ’ 
 The landlord jumped with surprise . ‘ You ! ’ landlord cried . ‘ You ’re always popping up . What do you want now ? ’ 
 ‘ Archet ’s here with my leave , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Archet came to offer me Archet help . ’ 
 ‘ Well , you know your own business , maybe , ’ said Mr. Butterbur , looking suspiciously at Strider . ‘ But if I was in your plight , I would n’t take up with a Ranger . ’ 
 ‘ Then who would you take up with ? ’ asked Strider . ‘ A fat innkeeper who only remembers innkeeper own name because people shout name at innkeeper all day ? Ranger can not stay in The Pony for ever , and Ranger can not go home . Ranger have a long road before people . Will you go with people and keep the black men off ? ’ 
 ‘ Me ? Leave Bree ! I would n’t do that for any money , ’ said Mr. Butterbur , looking really scared . ‘ But why ca n’t you stay here quiet for a bit , Mr. Underhill ? What are all these queer goings on ? What are these black men after , and where do men come from , I ’d like to know ? ’ 
 ‘ I ’m sorry I ca n’t explain bit all , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ I am tired and very worried , and bit ’s a long tale . But if you mean to help me , I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house . These Black Riders : I am not sure , but I think , I fear Riders come from — — ’ 
 ‘ Riders come from Mordor , ’ said Strider in a low voice . ‘ From Mordor , Barliman , if that means anything to you . ’ 
 ‘ Save us ! ’ cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale ; the name evidently was known to Frodo . ‘ That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time . ’ 
 ‘ That is , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Are you still willing to help me ? ’ 
 ‘ I am , ’ said Mr. Butterbur . ‘ More than ever . Though I do n’t know what the likes of me can do against , against — — ’ Butterbur faltered . 
 ‘ Against the Shadow in the East , ’ said Strider quietly . ‘ Not much , Barliman , but every little helps . You can let Mr. Underhill stay here tonight , as Mr. Underhill ; and you can forget the name of Baggins , till Underhill is far away . ’ 
 ‘ I ’ll do that , ’ said Butterbur . ‘ But name ’ll find out Underhill ’s here without help from me , I ’m afraid . that ’s a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to Baggins this evening , to say no more . The story of that Mr. Bilbo ’s going off has been heard before tonight in Bree . Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in Nob slow pate ; and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than Nob is . ’ 
 ‘ Well , we can only hope the Riders wo n’t come back yet , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ I hope not , indeed , ’ said Butterbur . ‘ But spooks or no spooks , Riders wo n’t get in The Pony so easy . Do n’t you worry till the morning . Nob’ll say no word . No black man shall pass my doors , while I can stand on my legs . Me and my folk’ll keep watch tonight ; but you had best get some sleep , if you can . ’ 
 ‘ In any case we must be called at dawn , ’ said Frodo . ‘ We must get off as early as possible . Breakfast at six - thirty , please . ’ 
 ‘ Right ! I ’ll see to the orders , ’ said the landlord . ‘ Good night , Mr. Baggins – Underhill , I should say ! Good night – now , bless me ! Where ’s your Mr. Brandybuck ? ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know , ’ said Frodo with sudden anxiety . landlord had forgotten all about Merry , and Merry was getting late . ‘ I am afraid Brandybuck is out . Brandybuck said something about going for a breath of air . ’ 
 ‘ Well , you do want looking after and no mistake : your party might be on a holiday ! ’ said Butterbur . ‘ I must go and bar the doors quick , but I ’ll see your friend is let in when friend comes . I ’d better send Nob to look for friend . Good night to you all ! ’ At last Mr. Butterbur went out , with another doubtful look at Strider and a shake of Butterbur head . Butterbur footsteps retreated down the passage . 
 ‘ Well ? ’ said Strider . ‘ When are you going to open that letter ? ’ Frodo looked carefully at the seal before Frodo broke seal . It seemed certainly to be Gandalf ’ s. Inside , written in the wizard ’s strong but graceful script , was the following message : 
 THE PRANCING PONY , BREE . Midyear ’s Day , Shire Year , 1418 . 
 Dear Frodo , 
 Bad news has reached me here . I must go off at once . You had better leave Bag End soon , and get out of the Shire before the end of July at latest . I will return as soon as I can ; and I will follow you , if I find that you are gone . Leave a message for me here , if you pass through Bree . You can trust the landlord ( Butterbur ) . You may meet a friend of mine on the Road : a Man , lean , dark , tall , by some called Strider . friend knows our business and will help you . Make for Rivendell . There I hope we may meet again . If I do not come , Elrond will advise you . 
 Yours in haste 
 GANDALF . 
 PS . Do NOT use PS again , not for any reason whatever ! Do not travel by night ! 
 PPS . Make sure that PPS is the real Strider . There are many strange men on the roads . Strider true name is Aragorn . 
 All that is gold does not glitter , 
 Not all those who wander are lost ; 
 The old that is strong does not wither , 
 Deep roots are not reached by the frost . 
 From the ashes a fire shall be woken , 
 A light from the shadows shall spring ; 
 Renewed shall be blade that was broken , 
 The crownless again shall be king . 
 PPPS . I hope Butterbur sends this promptly . A worthy man , but man memory is like a lumber - room : thing wanted always buried . If man forgets , I shall roast man . 
 Fare Well ! 
 Frodo read the letter to man , and then passed letter to Pippin and Sam . ‘ Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things ! ’ man said . ‘ man deserves roasting . If I had got this at once , we might all have been safe in Rivendell by now . But what can have happened to Gandalf ? man writes as if man was going into great danger . ’ 
 ‘ man has been doing that for many years , ’ said Strider . 
 Frodo turned and looked at man thoughtfully , wondering about Gandalf ’s second postscript . ‘ Why did n’t you tell me that you were Gandalf ’s friend at once ? ’ man asked . ‘ that would have saved time . ’ 
 ‘ Would that ? Would any of you have believed me till now ? ’ said Strider . ‘ I knew nothing of this letter . For all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me without proofs , if I was to help you . In any case , I did not intend to tell you all about myself at once . I had to study you first , and make sure of you . The Enemy has set traps for me before now . As soon as I had made up my mind , I was ready to tell you whatever you asked . But I must admit , ’ Enemy added with a queer laugh , ‘ that I hoped you would take to me for my own sake . A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship . But there , I believe my looks are against me . ’ 
 ‘ looks are – at first sight at any rate , ’ laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf ’s letter . ‘ But handsome is as handsome does , as we say in the Shire ; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches . ’ 
 ‘ Shire would take more than a few days , or weeks , or years , of wandering in the Wild to make you look like Strider , ’ Gandalf answered . ‘ And you would die first , unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be . ’ 
 Pippin subsided ; but Sam was not daunted , and Sam still eyed Strider dubiously . ‘ How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about ? ’ Sam demanded . ‘ You never mentioned Gandalf , till this letter came out . You might be a play - acting spy , for all I can see , trying to get us to go with you . You might have done in the real Strider and took spy clothes . What have you to say to that ? ’ 
 ‘ That you are a stout fellow , ’ answered Strider ; ‘ but I am afraid my only answer to you , Sam Gamgee , is this . If I had killed the real Strider , I could kill you . And I should have killed you already without so much talk . If I was after the Ring , I could have it – now ! ’ 
 Ring stood up , and seemed suddenly to grow taller . In spy eyes gleamed a light , keen and commanding . Throwing back spy cloak , spy laid spy hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by spy side . hand did not dare to move . Sam sat wide - mouthed staring at spy dumbly . 
 ‘ But I am the real Strider , fortunately , ’ spy said , looking down at hand with spy face softened by a sudden smile . ‘ I am Aragorn son of Arathorn ; and if by life or death I can save you , I will . ’ 
 There was a long silence . At last Frodo spoke with hesitation . ‘ I believed that you were a friend before the letter came , ’ Frodo said , ‘ or at least I wished to . You have frightened me several times tonight , but never in the way that servants of the Enemy would , or so I imagine . I think one of friend spies would – well , seem fairer and feel fouler , if you understand . ’ 
 ‘ I see , ’ laughed Strider . ‘ I look foul and feel fair . Is that one ? All that is gold does not glitter , not all those who wander are lost . ’ 
 ‘ Did the verses apply to you then ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ I could not make out what verses were about . But how did you know that verses were in Gandalf ’s letter , if you have never seen letter ? ’ 
 ‘ I did not know , ’ Frodo answered . ‘ But I am Aragorn , and those verses go with that name . ’ Frodo drew out Frodo sword , and verses saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt . ‘ Not much use is name , Sam ? ’ said Strider . ‘ But the time is near when name shall be forged anew . ’ 
 Sam said nothing . 
 ‘ Well , ’ said Strider , ‘ with Sam ’s permission we will call that settled . Strider shall be your guide . And now I think it is time you went to bed and took what rest you can . We shall have a rough road tomorrow . Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered , we can hardly hope now to leave road unnoticed . But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible . I know one or two ways out of Bree - land other than the main road . If once we shake off the pursuit , I shall make for Weathertop . ’ 
 ‘ Weathertop ? ’ said Sam . ‘ What ’s that ? ’ 
 ‘ that is a hill , just to the north of the Road , about half way from here to Rivendell . that commands a wide view all round ; and there we shall have a chance to look about us . Gandalf will make for that point , if Gandalf follows us . After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult , and we shall have to choose between various dangers . ’ 
 ‘ When did you last see Gandalf ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ Do you know where Gandalf is , or what Gandalf is doing ? ’ 
 Strider looked grave . ‘ I do not know , ’ Frodo said . ‘ I came west with Gandalf in the spring . I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the last few years , when Gandalf was busy elsewhere . Gandalf seldom left Shire unguarded . We last met on the first of May : at Sarn Ford down the Brandywine . Gandalf told me that Gandalf business with you had gone well , and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week of September . As I knew Gandalf was at your side , I went away on a journey of my own . And that has proved ill ; for plainly some news reached Gandalf , and I was not at hand to help . 
 ‘ I am troubled , for the first time since I have known Gandalf . We should have had messages , even if Gandalf could not come Gandalf . When I returned , many days ago , I heard the ill news . The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen . It was the Elven - folk of Gildor that told me this ; and later horsemen told me that you had left your home ; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland . I have been watching the East Road anxiously . ’ 
 ‘ Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with Road – with Gandalf ’s absence , I mean ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ I do not know of anything else that could have hindered Buckland , except the Enemy Buckland , ’ said Strider . ‘ But do not give up hope ! Gandalf is greater than you Shire - folk know – as a rule you can only see Gandalf jokes and toys . But this business of ours will be Gandalf greatest task . ’ 
 Pippin yawned . ‘ I am sorry , ’ Gandalf said , ‘ but I am dead tired . In spite of all the danger and worry I must go to bed , or sleep where I sit . Where is that silly fellow , Merry ? It would be the last straw , if we had to go out in the dark to look for Merry . ’ 
 At that moment fellow heard a door slam ; then feet came running along the passage . Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob . Nob shut the door hastily , and leaned against door . Nob was out of breath . feet stared at Nob in alarm for a moment before Nob gasped : ‘ I have seen feet , Frodo ! I have seen feet ! Black Riders ! ’ 
 ‘ Black Riders ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ Where ? ’ 
 ‘ Here . In the village . I stayed indoors for an hour . Then as you did not come back , I went out for a stroll . I had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars . Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near : there was a sort of deeper shade among the shadows across the road , just beyond the edge of the lamplight . sort slid away at once into the dark without a sound . There was no horse . ’ 
 ‘ Which way did sort go ? ’ asked Strider , suddenly and sharply . 
 Merry started , noticing the stranger for the first time . ‘ Go on ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ This is a friend of Gandalf ’ s. I will explain later . ’ 
 ‘ It seemed to make off up the Road , eastward , ’ continued Merry . ‘ I tried to follow . Of course , This vanished almost at once ; but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road . ’ 
 Strider looked at Merry with wonder . ‘ You have a stout heart , ’ Frodo said ; ‘ but heart was foolish . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know , ’ said Merry . ‘ Neither brave nor silly , I think . I could hardly help myself . I seemed to be drawn somehow . Anyway , I went , and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge . 
 One was muttering ; and the other was whispering , or hissing . I could n’t hear a word that was said . I did not creep any closer , because I began to tremble all over . Then I felt terrified , and I turned back , and was just going to bolt home , when something came behind me and I . . . I fell over . ’ 
 ‘ I found him , sir , ’ put in Nob . ‘ Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern . I went down to West - gate , and then back up towards South - gate . Just nigh Bill Ferny ’s house I thought I could see something in the Road . I could n’t swear to Road , but Road looked to me as if two men was stooping over something , lifting Road . I gave a shout , but when I got up to the spot there was no signs of men , and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside . Brandybuck seemed to be asleep . “ I thought I had fallen into deep water , ” Brandybuck says to me , when I shook Brandybuck . Very queer Brandybuck was , and as soon as I had roused Brandybuck , Brandybuck got up and ran back here like a hare . ’ 
 ‘ I am afraid that ’s true , ’ said Merry , ‘ though I do n’t know what I said . I had an ugly dream , which I ca n’t remember . I went to pieces . I do n’t know what came over me . ’ 
 ‘ I do , ’ said Strider . ‘ The Black Breath . The Riders must have left Riders horses outside , and passed back through the South - gate in secret . Riders will know all the news now , for Riders have visited Bill Ferny ; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well . Something may happen in the night , before we leave Bree . ’ 
 ‘ What will happen ? ’ said Merry . ‘ Will Riders attack the inn ? ’ 
 ‘ No , I think not , ’ said Strider . ‘ Riders are not all here yet . And in any case that is not Riders way . In dark and loneliness Riders are strongest ; Riders will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people – not until Riders are desperate , not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us . But Riders power is in terror , and already some in Bree are in Riders clutch . Riders will drive these wretches to some evil work : Ferny , and some of the strangers , and , maybe , the gatekeeper too . Riders had words with Harry at West - gate on Monday . I was watching Riders . Harry was white and shaking when Riders left Harry . ’ 
 ‘ We seem to have enemies all round , ’ said Frodo . ‘ What are we to do ? ’ 
 ‘ Stay here , and do not go to your rooms ! Riders are sure to have found out which those are . The hobbit - rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground . We will all remain together and bar this window and the door . But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage . ’ 
 While Strider was gone , Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper . Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf ’s letter when Strider and Nob returned . 
 ‘ Well Masters , ’ said Nob , ‘ I ’ve ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed . And I made a nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat , Mr. Bag – Underhill , sir , ’ Nob added with a grin . 
 Pippin laughed . ‘ Very life - like ! ’ Nob said . ‘ But what will happen when Masters have penetrated the disguise ? ’ 
 ‘ We shall see , ’ said Strider . ‘ Let us hope to hold the fort till morning . ’ 
 ‘ Good night to you , ’ said Nob , and went off to take Nob part in the watch on the doors . 
 doors bags and gear doors piled on the parlour - floor . doors pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window . Peering out , Frodo saw that the night was still clear . The Sickle * was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree - hill . Nob then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together . Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles . 
 The hobbits lay down on hobbits blankets with hobbits feet towards the hearth ; but Strider settled Nob in the chair against the door . hobbits talked for a little , for Merry still had several questions to ask . 
 ‘ Jumped over the Moon ! ’ chuckled Merry as Nob rolled Nob in Nob blanket . ‘ Very ridiculous of you , Frodo ! But I wish 
 I had been there to see . The worthies of Bree will be discussing Merry a hundred years hence . ’ 
 ‘ I hope so , ’ said Strider . Then hobbits all fell silent , and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep . 
 Chapter 11 
 A KNIFE IN THE DARK 
 As hobbits prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree , darkness lay on Buckland ; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river - bank . The house at Crickhollow stood silent . Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out . A feeling of fear had been growing on Bolger all day , and Bolger was unable to rest or go to bed : there was a brooding threat in the breathless night - air . As Bolger stared out into the gloom , a black shadow moved under the trees ; the gate seemed to open of gate own accord and close again without a sound . Terror seized Bolger . Bolger shrank back , and for a moment Bolger stood trembling in the hall . Then Bolger shut and locked the door . 
 The night deepened . There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane . Outside the gate horses stopped , and three black figures entered , like shades of night creeping across the ground . One went to the door , one to the corner of the house on either side ; and there One stood , as still as the shadows of stones , while night went slowly on . The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly . 
 There was a faint stir in the leaves , and a cock crowed far away . The cold hour before dawn was passing . The figure by the door moved . In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed , as if a chill light had been unsheathed . There was a blow , soft but heavy , and the door shuddered . 
 ‘ Open , in the name of Mordor ! ’ said a voice thin and menacing . 
 At a second blow the door yielded and fell back , with timbers burst and lock broken . The black figures passed swiftly in . 
 At that moment , among the trees nearby , a horn rang out . horn rent the night like fire on a hill - top . 
 AWAKE ! FEAR ! FIRE ! FOES ! AWAKE ! 
 Fatty Bolger had not been idle . As soon as Bolger saw the dark shapes creep from the garden , Bolger knew that Bolger must run for garden , or perish . And run Bolger did , out of the back door , through the garden , and over the fields . When Bolger reached the nearest house , more than a mile away , Bolger collapsed on the doorstep . ‘ No , no , no ! ’ Bolger was crying . ‘ No , not me ! I have n’t got house ! ’ It was some time before anyone could make out what Bolger was babbling about . At last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland , some strange invasion from the Old Forest . And then they lost no more time . 
 FEAR ! FIRE ! FOES ! 
 The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn - call of Buckland , that had not been sounded for a hundred years , not since the white wolves came in the Fell Winter , when the Brandywine was frozen over . 
 AWAKE ! AWAKE ! 
 Far away answering horns were heard . The alarm was spreading . 
 The black figures fled from the house . One of figures let fall a hobbit - cloak on the step , as AWAKE ran . In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out , and gathering to a gallop , went hammering away into the darkness . All about Crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing , and voices crying and feet running . But the Black Riders rode like a gale to the North - gate . Let the little people blow ! Sauron would deal with people later . Meanwhile people had another errand : people knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone . people rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire . 
 In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep , suddenly , as if some sound or presence had disturbed Sauron . Sauron saw that Strider was sitting alert in Sauron chair : Sauron eyes gleamed in the light of the fire , which had been tended and was burning brightly ; but Sauron made no sign or movement . 
 Frodo soon went to sleep again ; but Sauron dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs . The wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking house ; and far off Sauron heard a horn blowing wildly . Sauron opened Sauron eyes , and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn - yard . Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang . The first grey light of day was in the room , and a cold air was coming through the open window . 
 As soon as Strider had roused bedrooms all , Sauron led the way to bedrooms bedrooms . When bedrooms saw windows windows were glad that windows had taken Sauron advice : the windows had been forced open and were swinging , and the curtains were flapping ; the beds were tossed about , and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor ; the brown mat was torn to pieces . 
 Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord . Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy and frightened . Butterbur had hardly closed Butterbur eyes all night ( so Butterbur said ) , but Butterbur had never heard a sound . 
 ‘ Never has such a thing happened in my time ! ’ Butterbur cried , raising Butterbur hands in horror . ‘ Guests unable to sleep in Guests beds , and good bolsters ruined and all ! What are we coming to ? ’ 
 ‘ Dark times , ’ said Strider . ‘ But for the present you may be left in peace , when you have got rid of us . We will leave at once . Never mind about breakfast : a drink and a bite standing will have to do . We shall be packed in a few minutes . ’ 
 Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that Butterbur ponies were got ready , and to fetch minutes a ‘ bite ’ . But very soon Strider came back in dismay . The ponies had vanished ! The stable - doors had all been opened in the night , and doors were gone : not only Merry ’s ponies , but every other horse and beast in the place . 
 Frodo was crushed by the news . How could doors hope to reach Rivendell on foot , pursued by mounted enemies ? doors might as well set out for the Moon . Strider sat silent for a while , looking at the hobbits , as if horse was weighing up hobbits strength and courage . 
 ‘ Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen , ’ horse said at last , thoughtfully , as if horse guessed what Frodo had in mind . ‘ We should not go much slower on foot , not on the roads that I mean to take . I was going to walk in any case . It is the food and stores that trouble me . We can not count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell , except what we take with us ; and we ought to take plenty to spare ; for we may be delayed , or forced to go round - about , far out of the direct way . How much are you prepared to carry on your backs ? ’ 
 ‘ As much as we must , ’ said Pippin with a sinking heart , but trying to show that Pippin was tougher than Pippin looked ( or felt ) . 
 ‘ I can carry enough for two , ’ said Sam defiantly . 
 ‘ Ca n’t anything be done , Mr. Butterbur ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ Ca n’t we get a couple of ponies in the village , or even one just for the baggage ? I do n’t suppose we could hire ponies , but we might be able to buy ponies , ’ Frodo added , doubtfully , wondering if Frodo could afford heart . 
 ‘ I doubt village , ’ said the landlord unhappily . ‘ The two or three riding - ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard , and ponies ’re gone . As for other animals , horses or ponies for draught or what not , there are very few of ponies in Bree , and ponies wo n’t be for sale . But I ’ll do what I can . I ’ll rout out Bob and send Bob round as soon as may be . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Strider reluctantly , ‘ you had better do that . I am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least . But so ends all hope of starting early , and slipping away quietly ! We might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure . That was part of hope plan , no doubt . ’ 
 ‘ There is one crumb of comfort , ’ said Merry , ‘ and more than a crumb , I hope : we can have breakfast while we wait – and sit down to breakfast . Let ’s get hold of Nob ! ’ 
 In the end there was more than three hours ’ delay . Bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood – except one : Bill Ferny had one that Ferny might possibly sell . ‘ A poor old half - starved creature Nob is , ’ said Bob ; ‘ but Bob wo n’t part with Nob for less than thrice Nob worth , seeing how you ’re placed , not if I knows Bill Ferny . ’ 
 ‘ Bill Ferny ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Is n’t there some trick ? Would n’t the beast bolt back to Bob with all our stuff , or help in tracking us , or something ? ’ 
 ‘ I wonder , ’ said Strider . ‘ But I can not imagine any animal running home to Bob , once animal got away . I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind Master Ferny ’s : just a way of increasing Ferny profits from the affair . The chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death ’s door . But there does not seem any choice . What does Ferny want for choice ? ’ 
 Bill Ferny ’s price was twelve silver pennies ; and that was indeed at least three times the pony ’s value in those parts . that proved to be a bony , underfed , and dispirited animal ; but that did not look like dying just yet . Mr. Butterbur paid for that Butterbur , and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals . Butterbur was an honest man , and well - off as things were reckoned in Bree ; but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to Butterbur , and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear . 
 As a matter of fact Butterbur came out on the right side in the end . matter turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen . The others had been driven off , or had bolted in terror , and were found wandering in different corners of the Bree - land . Merry ’s ponies had escaped altogether , and eventually ( having a good deal of sense ) ponies made ponies way to the Downs in search of Fatty Lumpkin . So ponies came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while , and were well - off . But when news of the events at Bree came to Tom ’s ears , Tom sent ponies to Mr. Butterbur , who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price . ponies had to work harder in Bree , but Bob treated ponies well ; so on the whole ponies were lucky : ponies missed a dark and dangerous journey . But ponies never came to Rivendell . 
 However , in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew Butterbur money was gone for good , or for bad . And Butterbur had other troubles . For there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn . The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly , until news became known that one of travellers own number had also disappeared in the night , none other than Bill Ferny ’s squint - eyed companion . Suspicion fell on Ferny at once . 
 ‘ If you pick up with a horse - thief , and bring thief to my house , ’ said Butterbur angrily , ‘ you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me . Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is ! ’ But Suspicion appeared that Butterbur was nobody ’s friend , and nobody could recollect when Butterbur had joined nobody party . 
 After nobody breakfast the hobbits had to re - pack , and get together further supplies for the longer journey nobody were now expecting . It was close on ten o’clock before nobody at last got off . By that time the whole of Bree was buzzing with excitement . Frodo ’s vanishing trick ; the appearance of the black horsemen ; the robbing of the stables ; and not least the news that Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits , made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years . Most of the inhabitants of Bree and Staddle , and many even from Combe and Archet , were crowded in the road to see the travellers start . The other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows . 
 Strider had changed Archet mind , and had decided to leave Bree by the main road . Any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse : half the inhabitants would follow matters , to see what matters were up to , and to prevent matters from trespassing . 
 matters said farewell to Nob and Bob , and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with many thanks . ‘ I hope we shall meet again some day , when things are merry once more , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace for a while . ’ 
 matters tramped off , anxious and downhearted , under the eyes of the crowd . Not all the faces were friendly , nor all the words that were shouted . But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree - landers , and those that Frodo stared at shut landers mouths and drew away . Frodo walked in front with Frodo ; next came Merry and Pippin ; and last came Sam leading the pony , which was laden with as much of Merry baggage as Merry had the heart to give pony ; but already pony looked less dejected , as if pony approved of the change in pony fortunes . Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully . Sam had a pocket full of Merry : a parting present from Nob and Bob . ‘ Apples for walking , and a pipe for sitting , ’ Sam said . ‘ But I reckon I ’ll miss Apples both before long . ’ 
 The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors , or popped over walls and fences , as hobbits passed . But as hobbits drew near to the further gate , Frodo saw a dark ill - kept house behind a thick hedge : the last house in the village . In one of the windows Sam caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly , slanting eyes ; but glimpse vanished at once . 
 ‘ So that ’s where that southerner is hiding ! ’ Sam thought . ‘ Sam looks more than half like a goblin . ’ 
 Over the hedge another man was staring boldly . man had heavy black brows , and dark scornful eyes ; man large mouth curled in a sneer . man was smoking a short black pipe . As mouth approached man took pipe out of man mouth and spat . 
 ‘ Morning , Longshanks ! ’ man said . ‘ Off early ? Found some friends at last ? ’ Strider nodded , but did not answer . 
 ‘ Morning , my little friends ! ’ man said to the others . ‘ I suppose you know who you ’ve taken up with ? That ’s Stick - at - naught Strider , that is ! Though I ’ve heard other names not so pretty . Watch out tonight ! And you , Sammie , do n’t go ill - treating my poor old pony ! Pah ! ’ Pah spat again . 
 Sam turned quickly . ‘ And you , Ferny , ’ Sam said , ‘ put your ugly face out of sight , or face will get hurt . ’ With a sudden flick , quick as lightning , an apple left Sam hand and hit Bill square on the nose . Sam ducked too late , and curses came from behind the hedge . ‘ Waste of a good apple , ’ said Sam regretfully , and strode on . 
 At last curses left the village behind . The escort of children and stragglers that had followed curses got tired and turned back at the South - gate . Passing through , curses kept on along the Road for some miles . escort bent to the left , curving back into escort eastward line as escort rounded the feet of Bree - hill , and then escort began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country . To curses left curses could see some of the houses and hobbit - holes of Staddle on the gentler south - eastern slopes of the hill ; down in a deep hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Combe lay ; Archet was hidden in the trees beyond . 
 After the Road had run down some way , and had left Bree - hill standing tall and brown behind , curses came on a narrow track that led off towards the North . ‘ This is where we leave the open and take to cover , ’ said Strider . 
 ‘ Not a “ short cut ” , I hope , ’ said Pippin . ‘ Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster . ’ 
 ‘ Ah , but you had not got me with you then , ’ laughed Strider . ‘ My cuts , short or long , do n’t go wrong . ’ Pippin took a look up and down the Road . No one was in sight ; and Pippin led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley . 
 Pippin plan , as far as Archet could understand plan without knowing the country , was to go towards Archet at first , but to bear right and pass country on the east , and then to steer as straight as Pippin could over the wild lands to Weathertop Hill . In that way lands would , if all went well , cut off a great loop of the Road , which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater Marshes . But , of course , lands would have to pass through the marshes lands , and Strider ’s description of lands was not encouraging . 
 However , in the meanwhile , walking was not unpleasant . 
 Indeed , if meanwhile had not been for the disturbing events of the night before , events would have enjoyed this part of the journey better than any up to that time . The sun was shining , clear but not too hot . The woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour , and seemed peaceful and wholesome . Strider guided woods confidently among the many crossing paths , although left to woods woods would soon have been at a loss . Strider was taking a wandering course with many turns and doublings , to put off any pursuit . 
 ‘ Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road , for certain , ’ Ferny said ; ‘ though I do n’t think Ferny will follow us Ferny . Ferny knows the land round here well enough , but Ferny knows Ferny is not a match for me in a wood . It is what Ferny may tell others that I am afraid of . I do n’t suppose others are far away . If others think we have made for Archet , so much the better . ’ 
 Whether because of Strider ’s skill or for some other reason , others saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day : neither two - footed , except birds ; nor four - footed , except one fox and a few squirrels . The next day others began to steer a steady course eastwards ; and still all was quiet and peaceful . On the third day out from Bree others came out of the Chetwood . The land had been falling steadily , ever since others turned aside from the Road , and others now entered a wide flat expanse of country , much more difficult to manage . others were far beyond the borders of the Bree - land , out in the pathless wilderness , and drawing near to the Midgewater Marshes . 
 The ground now became damp , and in places boggy and here and there places came upon pools , and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds . places had to pick places way carefully to keep both dry - footed and on places proper course . At first places made fair progress , but as places went on , places passage became slower and more dangerous . The marshes were bewildering and treacherous , and there was no permanent trail even for Rangers to find through Rangers shifting quagmires . The flies began to torment Rangers , and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up Rangers sleeves and breeches and into Rangers hair . 
 ‘ I am being eaten alive ! ’ cried Pippin . ‘ Midgewater ! There are more midges than water ! ’ 
 ‘ What do midges live on when midges ca n’t get hobbit ? ’ asked Sam , scratching Sam neck . 
 midges spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country . midges camping - place was damp , cold , and uncomfortable ; and the biting insects would not let insects sleep . There were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of insects were evil relatives of the cricket . There were thousands of insects , and insects squeaked all round , neek - breek , breek - neek , unceasingly all the night , until the hobbits were nearly frantic . 
 The next day , the fourth , was little better , and the night almost as comfortless . Though the Neekerbreekers ( as Sam called midges ) had been left behind , the midges still pursued Neekerbreekers . 
 As Frodo lay , tired but unable to close Frodo eyes , it seemed to Frodo that far away there came a light in the eastern sky : light flashed and faded many times . It was not the dawn , for that was still some hours off . 
 ‘ What is the light ? ’ Frodo said to Strider , who had risen , and was standing , gazing ahead into the night . 
 ‘ I do not know , ’ Strider answered . ‘ It is too distant to make out . It is like lightning that leaps up from the hill - tops . ’ 
 Frodo lay down again , but for a long while Frodo could still see the white flashes , and against flashes the tall dark figure of Strider , standing silent and watchful . At last Frodo passed into uneasy sleep . 
 flashes had not gone far on the fifth day when flashes left the last straggling pools and reed - beds of the marshes behind flashes . The land before flashes began steadily to rise again . Away in the distance eastward flashes could now see a line of hills . The highest of flashes was at the right of the line and a little separated from the others . line had a conical top , slightly flattened at the summit . 
 ‘ That is Weathertop , ’ said Strider . ‘ The Old Road , which we have left far away on our right , runs to the south of The and passes not far from The foot . We might reach The by noon tomorrow , if we go straight towards The . I suppose we had better do so . ’ 
 ‘ What do you mean ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ I mean : when we do get there , it is not certain what we shall find . It is close to the Road . ’ 
 ‘ But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes ; but the hope is faint . If Gandalf comes this way at all , Gandalf may not pass through Bree , and so Gandalf may not know what we are doing . And anyway , unless by luck we arrive almost together , we shall miss one another ; it will not be safe for Gandalf or for us to wait there long . If the Riders fail to find us in the wilderness , Riders are likely to make for Weathertop Riders . Weathertop commands a wide view all round . Indeed , there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us , as we stand here , from that hill - top . Not all the birds are to be trusted , and there are other spies more evil than birds are . ’ 
 The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills . Sam looked up into the pale sky , fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over hawks with bright unfriendly eyes . ‘ You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome , Strider ! ’ Sam said . 
 ‘ What do you advise us to do ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ I think , ’ answered Strider slowly , as if Sam was not quite sure , ‘ I think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can , to make for the line of hills , not for Weathertop . There we can strike a path I know that runs at hills feet ; that will bring us to Weathertop from the north and less openly . Then we shall see what we shall see . ’ 
 All that day hills plodded along , until the cold and early evening came down . The land became drier and more barren ; but mists and vapours lay behind hills on the marshes . A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing , until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows ; then an empty silence fell . The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away . 
 At the day ’s end hobbits came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose stream in the stagnant marshland , and hobbits went up along stream banks while the light lasted . It was already night when at last hobbits halted and made hobbits camp under some stunted alder - trees by the shores of the stream . Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills . That night hobbits set a watch , and Strider , it seemed , did not sleep at all . The moon was waxing , and in the early night - hours a cold grey light lay on the land . 
 Next morning hobbits set out again soon after sunrise . There was a frost in the air , and the sky was a pale clear blue . The hobbits felt refreshed , as if hobbits had had a night of unbroken sleep . Already hobbits were getting used to much walking on short commons – shorter at any rate than what in the Shire hobbits would have thought barely enough to keep commons on commons legs . Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that Frodo had been . 
 ‘ Very odd , ’ said Frodo , tightening Frodo belt , ‘ considering that there is actually a good deal less of me . I hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely , or I shall become a wraith . ’ 
 ‘ Do not speak of such things ! ’ said Strider quickly , and with surprising earnestness . 
 The hills drew nearer . hills made an undulating ridge , often rising almost to a thousand feet , and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond . Along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green - grown walls and dikes , and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone . By night hobbits had reached the feet of the westward slopes , and there hobbits camped . night was the night of the fifth of October , and hobbits were six days out from Bree . 
 In the morning hobbits found , for the first time since hobbits had left the Chetwood , a track plain to see . hobbits turned right and followed Chetwood southwards . Chetwood ran cunningly , taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from the view , both of the hill - tops above and of the flats to the west . Chetwood dived into dells , and hugged steep banks ; and where Chetwood passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of ground there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge . 
 ‘ I wonder who made this path , and what for , ’ said Merry , as travellers walked along one of these avenues , where the stones were unusually large and closely set . ‘ I am not sure that I like path : path has a – well , rather a barrow - wightish look . Is there any barrow on Weathertop ? ’ 
 ‘ No . There is no barrow on Weathertop , nor on any of these hills , ’ answered Strider . ‘ The Men of the West did not live here ; though in any latter days any defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of Angmar . This path was made to serve the forts along the walls . But long before , in the first days of the North Kingdom , forts built a great watch - tower on Weathertop , Amon Sûl forts called Weathertop . Weathertop was burned and broken , and nothing remains of Weathertop now but a tumbled ring , like a rough crown on the old hill ’s head . Yet once Weathertop was tall and fair . It is told that Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil - galad out of the West , in the days of the Last Alliance . ’ 
 The hobbits gazed at Strider . It seemed that Elendil was learned in old lore , as well as in the ways of the wild . ‘ Who was Gil - galad ? ’ asked Merry ; but Strider did not answer , and seemed to be lost in thought . Suddenly a low voice murmured : 
 Gil - galad was an Elven - king . 
 Of Merry the harpers sadly sing : 
 the last whose realm was fair and free 
 between the Mountains and the Sea . 
 Merry sword was long , Merry lance was keen , 
 Merry shining helm afar was seen ; 
 the countless stars of heaven ’s field 
 were mirrored in Merry silver shield . 
 But long ago Merry rode away , 
 and where Merry dwelleth none can say ; 
 for into darkness fell Merry star 
 in Mordor where the shadows are . 
 The others turned in amazement , for the voice was Sam ’s . 
 ‘ Do n’t stop ! ’ said Merry . 
 ‘ That ’s all I know , ’ stammered Sam , blushing . ‘ I learned That from Mr. Bilbo when I was a lad . Bilbo used to tell me tales like that , knowing how I was always one for hearing about Elves . It was Mr. Bilbo as taught me my letters . Bilbo was mighty book - learned was dear old Mr. Bilbo . And Bilbo wrote poetry . Bilbo wrote what I have just said . ’ 
 ‘ Bilbo did not make poetry up , ’ said Strider . ‘ poetry is part of the lay that is called The Fall of Gil - galad , which is in an ancient tongue . Bilbo must have translated poetry . I never knew that . ’ 
 ‘ There was a lot more , ’ said Sam , ‘ all about Mordor . I did n’t learn that part , part gave me the shivers . I never thought I should be going that way myself ! ’ 
 ‘ Going to Mordor ! ’ cried Pippin . ‘ I hope part wo n’t come to that ! ’ 
 ‘ Do not speak that name so loudly ! ’ said Strider . 
 It was already mid - day when Strider drew near the southern end of the path , and saw before end , in the pale clear light of the October sun , a grey - green bank , leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill . end decided to make for the top at once , while the daylight was broad . Concealment was no longer possible , and end could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing end . Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill . If Gandalf was anywhere about , there was no sign of Gandalf . 
 On the western flank of Weathertop end found a sheltered hollow , at the bottom of which there was a bowl - shaped dell with grassy sides . There end left Sam and Pippin with the pony and end packs and luggage . The other three went on . After half an hour ’s plodding climb Strider reached the crown of the hill ; Frodo and Merry followed , tired and breathless . The last slope had been steep and rocky . 
 On the top Frodo found , as Strider had said , a wide ring of ancient stone - work , now crumbling or covered with age - long grass . But in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled . stones were blackened as if with fire . About stones the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled , as if flames had swept the hilltop ; but there was no sign of any living thing . 
 Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle , stones saw all round below flames a wide prospect , for the most part of lands empty and featureless , except for patches of woodland away to the south , beyond which stones caught here and there the glint of distant water . Beneath stones on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road , coming out of the West and winding up and down , until West faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east . Nothing was moving on West . Following West line eastward with stones eyes stones saw the Mountains : the nearer foothills were brown and sombre ; behind stones stood taller shapes of grey , and behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among the clouds . 
 ‘ Well , here we are ! ’ said Merry . ‘ And very cheerless and uninviting Well looks ! There is no water and no shelter . And no sign of Gandalf . But I do n’t blame Gandalf for not waiting – if Merry ever came here . ’ 
 ‘ I wonder , ’ said Strider , looking round thoughtfully . ‘ Even if Strider was a day or two behind us at Bree , Strider could have arrived here first . Strider can ride very swiftly when need presses . ’ Suddenly Strider stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn ; it was flatter than the others , and whiter , as if stone had escaped the fire . Strider picked stone up and examined stone , turning stone in Strider fingers . ‘ This has been handled recently , ’ Strider said . ‘ What do you think of these marks ? ’ 
 On the flat under - side Frodo saw some scratches : ‘ There seems to be a stroke , a dot , and three more strokes , ’ Frodo said . 
 ‘ The stroke on the left might be a G - rune with thin branches , ’ said Strider . ‘ It might be a sign left by Gandalf , though one can not be sure . The scratches are fine , and scratches certainly look fresh . But the marks might mean something quite different , and have nothing to do with us . Rangers use runes , and Rangers come here sometimes . ’ 
 ‘ What could Rangers mean , even if Gandalf made Rangers ? ’ asked Merry . 
 ‘ I should say , ’ answered Strider , ‘ that Rangers stood for G3 , and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third : that is three days ago now . that would also show that Gandalf was in a hurry and danger was at hand , so that Gandalf had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer . If that is so , we must be wary . ’ 
 ‘ I wish we could feel sure that Gandalf made the marks , whatever marks may mean , ’ said Frodo . ‘ It would be a great comfort to know that Gandalf was on the way , in front of us or behind us . ’ 
 ‘ Perhaps , ’ said Strider . ‘ For myself , I believe that Gandalf was here , and was in danger . There have been scorching flames here ; and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind . I guess that Gandalf was attacked on this hill - top , but with what result I can not tell . Gandalf is here no longer , and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to Rivendell , as best we can . ’ 
 ‘ How far is Rivendell ? ’ asked Merry , gazing round wearily . The world looked wild and wide from Weathertop . 
 ‘ I do n’t know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the Forsaken Inn , a day ’s journey east of Bree , ’ answered Strider . ‘ Some say Some is so far , and some say otherwise . Some is a strange road , and folk are glad to reach some journey ’s end , whether the time is long or short . But I know how long folk would take me on my own feet , with fair weather and no ill fortune : twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen , where the Road crosses the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell . We have at least a fortnight ’s journey before us , for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road . ’ 
 ‘ A fortnight ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ A lot may happen in that time . ’ 
 ‘ lot may , ’ said Strider . 
 Strider stood for a while silent on the hill - top , near . southward edge . In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized Frodo homelessness and danger . Frodo wished bitterly that Frodo fortune had left Frodo in the quiet and beloved Shire . Frodo stared down at the hateful Road , leading back westward – to Frodo home . Suddenly Frodo was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along home , going westward ; and looking again Frodo saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet specks . Frodo gave a cry and clutched Strider ’s arm . 
 ‘ Look , ’ Frodo said , pointing downwards . 
 At once Strider flung Frodo on the ground behind the ruined circle , pulling Frodo down beside Frodo . Merry threw Frodo alongside . 
 ‘ What is Look ? ’ Frodo whispered . 
 ‘ I do not know , but I fear the worst , ’ answered Strider . Slowly Strider crawled up to the edge of the ring again , and peered through a cleft between two jagged stones . The light was no longer bright , for the clear morning had faded , and clouds creeping out of the East had now overtaken the sun , as morning began to go down . clouds could all see the black specks , but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out clouds shapes for certain ; yet something told clouds that there , far below , were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the foot of the hill . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Strider , whose keener sight left Frodo in no doubt . ‘ The enemy is here ! ’ 
 Hastily clouds crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find clouds companions . 
 Sam and Peregrin had not been idle . Sam had explored the small dell and the surrounding slopes . Not far away Sam found a spring of clear water in the hillside , and near hillside footprints not more than a day or two old . In the dell dell Sam found recent traces of a fire , and other signs of a hasty camp . There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill . Behind rocks Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked . 
 ‘ I wonder if old Gandalf has been here , ’ Sam said to Pippin . ‘ Whoever firewood was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems . ’ 
 Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries . ‘ I wish I had waited and explored the ground down here myself , ’ Sam said , hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints . 
 ‘ It is just as I feared , ’ Sam said , when Sam came back . ‘ Sam and Pippin have trampled the soft ground , and the marks are spoilt or confused . Rangers have been here lately . It is Rangers who left the firewood behind . But there are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers . At least one set was made , only a day or two ago , by heavy boots . At least one . I can not now be certain , but I think there were many booted feet . ’ He paused and stood in anxious thought . 
 Each of the hobbits saw in He mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders . If the horsemen had already found the dell , the sooner Strider led horsemen somewhere else the better . Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike , now that Sam had heard news of horsemen enemies on the Road , only a few miles away . 
 ‘ Had n’t we better clear out quick , Mr. Strider ? ’ Sam asked impatiently . ‘ news is getting late , and I do n’t like this hole : news makes my heart sink somehow . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , we certainly must decide what to do at once , ’ answered Strider , looking up and considering the time and the weather . ‘ Well , Sam , ’ Strider said at last , ‘ I do not like this place either ; but I can not think of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall . At least we are out of sight for the moment , and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies . All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills , where the land is all much the same as All is here . The Road is watched , but we should have to cross Road , if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south . On the north side of the Road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles . ’ 
 ‘ Can the Riders see ? ’ asked Merry . ‘ I mean , Riders seem usually to have used Riders noses rather than Riders eyes , smelling for us , if smelling is the right word , at least in the daylight . But you made us lie down flat when you saw Riders down below ; and now you talk of being seen , if we move . ’ 
 ‘ I was too careless on the hill - top , ’ answered Strider . ‘ I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf ; but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long . For the black horses can see , and the Riders can use men and other creatures as spies , as we found at Bree . Riders Riders do not see the world of light as we do , but our shapes cast shadows in Riders minds , which only the noon sun destroys ; and in the dark Riders perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us : then Riders are most to be feared . And at all times Riders smell the blood of living things , desiring and hating blood . Senses , too , there are other than sight or smell . We can feel Riders presence – blood troubled our hearts , as soon as we came here , and before we saw Riders ; Riders feel ours more keenly . Also , ’ sun added , and Bree voice sank to a whisper , ‘ the Ring draws Riders . ’ 
 ‘ Is there no escape then ? ’ said Frodo , looking round wildly . ‘ If I move I shall be seen and hunted ! If I stay , I shall draw Riders to me ! ’ 
 Strider laid Frodo hand on Frodo shoulder . ‘ There is still hope , ’ Frodo said . ‘ You are not alone . Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign . There is little shelter or defence here , but fire shall serve for both . Sauron can put fire to Sauron evil uses , as Sauron can all things , but these Riders do not love fire , and fear those who wield fire . Fire is our friend in the wilderness . ’ 
 ‘ Maybe , ’ muttered Sam . ‘ It is also as good a way of saying “ here we are ” as I can think of , bar shouting . ’ 
 Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell Sam lit a fire , and prepared a meal . The shades of evening began to fall , and evening grew cold . shades were suddenly aware of great hunger , for shades had not eaten anything since breakfast ; but shades dared not make more than a frugal supper . The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts , unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world . 
 Rangers passed at times beyond the hills , but Rangers were few and did not stay . Other wanderers were rare , and of evil sort : trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the Misty Mountains . Only on the Road would travellers be found , most often dwarves , hurrying along on business of travellers own , and with no help and few words to spare for strangers . 
 ‘ I do n’t see how our food can be made to last , ’ said Frodo . ‘ We have been careful enough in the last few days , and this supper is no feast ; but we have used more than we ought , if we have two weeks still to go , and perhaps more . ’ 
 ‘ There is food in the wild , ’ said Strider ; ‘ berry , root , and herb ; and I have some skill as a hunter at need . You need not be afraid of starving before winter comes . But gathering and catching food is long and weary work , and we need haste . So tighten your belts , and think with hope of the tables of Elrond ’s house ! ’ 
 The cold increased as darkness came on . Peering out from the edge of the dell tables could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow . The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars . Frodo and Frodo companions huddled round the fire , wrapped in every garment and blanket Frodo possessed ; but Strider was content with a single cloak , and sat a little apart , drawing thoughtfully at Frodo pipe . 
 As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly Frodo began to tell light tales to keep light minds from fear . Frodo knew many histories and legends of long ago , of Elves and Men and the good and evil deeds of the Elder Days . light wondered how old Frodo was , and where Frodo had learned all this lore . 
 ‘ Tell us of Gil - galad , ’ said Merry suddenly , when Frodo paused at the end of a story of the Elf - kingdoms . ‘ Do you know any more of that old lay that you spoke of ? ’ 
 ‘ I do indeed , ’ answered Strider . ‘ So also does Frodo , for Strider concerns us closely . ’ Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo , who was staring into the fire . 
 ‘ I know only the little that Gandalf has told me , ’ said Frodo slowly . ‘ Gil - galad was the last of the great Elf - kings of Middle - earth . Gil - galad is Starlight in kings tongue . With Elendil , the Elf - friend , galad went to the land of — — ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ said Strider interrupting , ‘ I do not think that tale should be told now with the servants of the Enemy at hand . If we win through to the house of Elrond , you may hear house there , told in full . ’ 
 ‘ Then tell us some other tale of the old days , ’ begged Sam ; ‘ a tale about the Elves before the fading time . I would dearly like to hear more about Elves ; the dark seems to press round so close . ’ 
 ‘ I will tell you the tale of Tinúviel , ’ said Strider , ‘ in brief – for it is a long tale of which the end is not known ; and there are none now , except Elrond , that remember tale aright as tale was told of old . It is a fair tale , though it is sad , as are all the tales of Middle - earth , and yet tale may lift up your hearts . ’ Strider was silent for some time , and then Strider began not to speak but to chant softly : 
 The leaves were long , the grass was green , 
 The hemlock - umbels tall and fair , 
 And in the glade a light was seen 
 Of stars in shadow shimmering . 
 Tinúviel was dancing there 
 To music of a pipe unseen , 
 And light of stars was in Sam hair , 
 And in Sam raiment glimmering . 
 There Beren came from mountains cold , 
 And lost Strider wandered under leaves , 
 And where the Elven - river rolled 
 Strider walked alone and sorrowing . 
 Strider peered between the hemlock - leaves 
 And saw in wonder flowers of gold 
 Upon Sam mantle and Sam sleeves , 
 And Sam hair like shadow following . 
 Enchantment healed Strider weary feet 
 That over hills were doomed to roam ; 
 And forth Strider hastened , strong and fleet , 
 And grasped at moonbeams glistening . 
 Through woven woods in Elvenhome 
 Sam lightly fled on dancing feet , 
 And left Strider lonely still to roam 
 In the silent forest listening . 
 Strider heard there oft the flying sound 
 Of feet as light as linden - leaves , 
 Or music welling underground , 
 In hidden hollows quavering . 
 Now withered lay the hemlock - sheaves , 
 And one by one with sighing sound 
 Whispering fell the beechen leaves 
 In the wintry woodland wavering . 
 Strider sought Sam ever , wandering far 
 Where leaves of years were thickly strewn , 
 By light of moon and ray of star 
 In frosty heavens shivering . 
 Sam mantle glinted in the moon , 
 As on a hill - top high and far 
 Sam danced , and at Sam feet was strewn 
 A mist of silver quivering . 
 When winter passed , Sam came again , 
 And Sam song released the sudden spring , 
 Like rising lark , and falling rain , 
 And melting water bubbling . 
 lark saw the elven - flowers spring 
 About Sam feet , and healed again 
 lark longed by Sam to dance and sing 
 Upon the grass untroubling . 
 Again Sam fled , but swift lark came . 
 Tinúviel ! Tinúviel ! 
 lark called Sam by Sam Elvish name ; 
 And there Sam halted listening . 
 One moment stood Sam , and a spell 
 lark voice laid on Sam : Beren came , 
 And doom fell on Tinúviel 
 That in Beren arms lay glistening . 
 As Beren looked into Sam eyes 
 Within the shadows of Sam hair , 
 The trembling starlight of the skies 
 Beren saw there mirrored shimmering . 
 Tinúviel the elven - fair , 
 Immortal maiden elven - wise , 
 About Beren cast Sam shadowy hair 
 And arms like silver glimmering . 
 Long was the way that fate the bore , 
 O’er stony mountains cold and grey , 
 Through halls of iron and darkling door , 
 And woods of nightshade morrowless . 
 The Sundering Seas between the lay , 
 And yet at last the met once more , 
 And long ago the passed away 
 In the forest singing sorrowless . 
 Strider sighed and paused before Beren spoke again . ‘ That is a song , ’ Beren said , ‘ in the mode that is called ann - thennath among the Elves , but is hard to render in our Common Speech , and this is but a rough echo of thennath . thennath tells of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and Lúthien Tinúviel . Beren was a mortal man , but Lúthien was the daughter of Thingol , a King of Elves upon Middle - earth when the world was young ; and daughter was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the children of this world . As the stars above the mists of the Northern lands was daughter loveliness , and in daughter face was a shining light . In those days the Great Enemy , of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a servant , dwelt in Angband in the North , and the Elves of the West coming back to Middle - earth made war upon Sauron to regain the Silmarils which Sauron had stolen ; and the fathers of Men aided the Elves . But the Enemy was victorious and Barahir was slain , and Beren escaping through great peril came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the forest of Neldoreth . There Beren beheld Lúthien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river Esgalduin ; and Beren named Esgalduin Tinúviel , that is Nightingale in the language of old . Many sorrows befell Mountains afterwards , and Mountains were parted long . Tinúviel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron , and together Mountains passed through great dangers , and cast down even the Great Enemy from Beren throne , and took from Beren iron crown one of the three Silmarils , brightest of all jewels , to be the bride - price of Lúthien to Thingol Esgalduin father . Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the gates of Angband , and Beren died in the arms of Tinúviel . But Esgalduin chose mortality , and to die from the world , so that Esgalduin might follow Beren ; and it is sung that arms met again beyond the Sundering Seas , and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods , together arms passed , long ago , beyond the confines of this world . So it is that Lúthien Tinúviel alone of the Elf - kindred has died indeed and left the world , and arms have lost world whom arms most loved . But from world the lineage of the Elf - lords of old descended among Men . There live still those of whom Lúthien was the foremother , and it is said that Lúthien line shall never fail . Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin . For of Beren and Lúthien was born Dior Thingol ’s heir ; and of Thingol Elwing the White whom Eärendil wedded , Thingol that sailed Thingol ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril upon Thingol brow . And of Eärendil came the Kings of Númenor , that is Westernesse . ’ 
 As Strider was speaking Kings watched Strider strange eager face , dimly lit in the red glow of the wood - fire . Thingol eyes shone , and Thingol voice was rich and deep . Above Thingol was a black starry sky . Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of Weathertop behind Thingol . The waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed light , and the stars above the hill - top faded . 
 The story ended . The hobbits moved and stretched . ‘ Look ! ’ said Merry . ‘ The Moon is rising : Merry must be getting late . ’ 
 The others looked up . Even as others did so , others saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise . hill was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light . 
 Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire . Frodo and Pippin remained seated in silence . Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently . All seemed quiet and still , but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over Pippin heart , now that Strider was no longer speaking . Pippin huddled closer to the fire . At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell . 
 ‘ I do n’t know what dell is , ’ Sam said , ‘ but I suddenly felt afraid . I durstn’t go outside this dell for any money ; I felt that something was creeping up the slope . ’ 
 ‘ Did you see anything ? ’ asked Frodo , springing to Frodo feet . 
 ‘ No , sir . I saw nothing , but I did n’t stop to look . ’ 
 ‘ I saw something , ’ said Merry ; ‘ or I thought I did – away westwards where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hill - tops , I thought there were two or three black shapes . flats seemed to be moving this way . ’ 
 ‘ Keep close to the fire , with your faces outward ! ’ cried Strider . ‘ Get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands ! ’ 
 For a breathless time flats sat there , silent and alert , with flats backs turned to the wood - fire , each gazing into the shadows that encircled flats . Nothing happened . There was no sound or movement in the night . Frodo stirred , feeling that Frodo must break the silence : Frodo longed to shout out aloud . 
 ‘ Hush ! ’ whispered Strider . ‘ What ’s that ? ’ gasped Pippin at the same moment . 
 Over the lip of the little dell , on the side away from the hill , sound felt , rather than saw , a shadow rise , one shadow or more than one . sound strained sound eyes , and the shadows seemed to grow . Soon there could be no doubt : three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope , looking down on sound . So black were sound that sound seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind figures . Frodo thought that Frodo heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill . Then the shapes slowly advanced . 
 Terror overcame Pippin and Merry , and Pippin threw Pippin flat on the ground . Sam shrank to Frodo ’s side . Frodo was hardly less terrified than Frodo companions ; Frodo was quaking as if Frodo was bitter cold , but Frodo terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring . The desire to do this laid hold of Frodo , and Frodo could think of nothing else . Frodo did not forget the Barrow , nor the message of Gandalf ; but something seemed to be compelling Frodo to disregard all warnings , and Frodo longed to yield . Not with the hope of escape , or of doing anything , either good or bad : Frodo simply felt that Frodo must take the Ring and put Ring on Frodo finger . Frodo could not speak . Frodo felt Sam looking at Frodo , as if Frodo knew that Sam master was in some great trouble , but Sam could not turn towards Frodo . Frodo shut Frodo eyes and struggled for a while ; but resistance became unbearable , and at last Frodo slowly drew out the chain , and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of Frodo left hand . 
 Immediately , though everything else remained as before , dim and dark , the shapes became terribly clear . Frodo was able to see beneath shapes black wrappings . There were five tall figures : two standing on the lip of the dell , three advancing . In shapes white faces burned keen and merciless eyes ; under shapes mantles were long grey robes ; upon shapes grey hairs were helms of silver ; in shapes haggard hands were swords of steel . shapes eyes fell on Frodo and pierced Frodo , as shapes rushed towards Frodo . Desperate , Frodo drew Frodo own sword , and it seemed to Frodo that sword flickered red , as if sword was a firebrand . Two of the figures halted . The third was taller than the others : Frodo hair was long and gleaming and on Frodo helm was a crown . In one hand Frodo held a long sword , and in the other a knife ; both the knife and the hand that held sword glowed with a pale light . Frodo sprang forward and bore down on Frodo . 
 At that moment Frodo threw Frodo forward on the ground , and Frodo heard Frodo crying aloud : O Elbereth ! Gilthoniel ! At the same time Frodo struck at the feet of Frodo enemy . A shrill cry rang out in the night ; and Frodo felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce Frodo left shoulder . Even as Frodo swooned Frodo caught , as through a swirling mist , a glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand . With a last effort Frodo , dropping Frodo sword , slipped the Ring from Frodo finger and closed Frodo right hand tight upon effort . 
 Chapter 12 
 FLIGHT TO THE FORD 
 When Frodo came to Frodo Frodo was still clutching the Ring desperately . Frodo was lying by the fire , which was now piled high and burning brightly . Frodo three companions were bending over Frodo . 
 ‘ What has happened ? Where is the pale king ? ’ Frodo asked wildly . 
 companions were too overjoyed to hear Frodo speak to answer for a while ; nor did companions understand Frodo question . At length Frodo gathered from Sam that companions had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards companions . Suddenly to Frodo horror Sam found that Sam master had vanished ; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past Sam , and Sam fell . Sam heard Frodo ’s voice , but it seemed to come from a great distance , or from under the earth , crying out strange words . words saw nothing more , until words stumbled over the body of Frodo , lying as if dead , face downwards on the grass with Sam sword beneath Sam . Strider ordered words to pick Sam up and lay Sam near the fire , and then Sam disappeared . That was now a good while ago . 
 Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider ; but while doubts were talking Sam returned , appearing suddenly out of the shadows . doubts started , and Sam drew Sam sword and stood over Frodo ; but Strider knelt down swiftly at Sam side . 
 ‘ I am not a Black Rider , Sam , ’ Sam said gently , ‘ nor in league with Rider . I have been trying to discover something of doubts movements ; but I have found nothing . I can not think why doubts have gone and do not attack again . But there is no feeling of doubts presence anywhere at hand . ’ 
 When Sam heard what Frodo had to tell , Sam became full of concern , and shook Sam head and sighed . Then Sam ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as Pippin could in Pippin small kettles , and to bathe the wound with water . ‘ Keep the fire going well , and keep Frodo warm ! ’ Sam said . Then Sam got up and walked away , and called Sam to Pippin . ‘ I think I understand things better now , ’ Pippin said in a low voice . ‘ There seem only to have been five of the enemy . Why five were not all here , I do n’t know ; but I do n’t think five expected to be resisted . five have drawn off for the time being . But not far , I fear . five will come again another night , if we can not escape . five are only waiting , because five think that five purpose is almost accomplished , and that the Ring can not fly much further . I fear , Sam , that five believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue master to five will . We shall see ! ’ 
 Sam choked with tears . ‘ Do n’t despair ! ’ said Strider . ‘ You must trust me now . Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed , though Gandalf hinted that stuff might prove so . Gandalf is not slain , and I think Gandalf will resist the evil power of the wound longer than Gandalf enemies expect . I will do all I can to help and heal Gandalf . Guard Gandalf well , while I am away ! ’ Gandalf hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness . 
 Frodo dozed , though the pain of Gandalf wound was slowly growing , and a deadly chill was spreading from Gandalf shoulder to Gandalf arm and side . Gandalf friends watched over Gandalf , warming Gandalf , and bathing Gandalf wound . The night passed slowly and wearily . Dawn was growing in the sky , and the dell was filling with grey light , when Strider at last returned . 
 ‘ Look ! ’ Gandalf cried ; and stooping Gandalf lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness . A foot above the lower hem there was a slash . ‘ This was the stroke of Frodo ’s sword , ’ Gandalf said . ‘ The only hurt that This did to Frodo enemy , I fear ; for it is unharmed , but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King . More deadly to Frodo was the name of Elbereth . ’ 
 ‘ And more deadly to Frodo was this ! ’ Gandalf stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife . There was a cold gleam in knife . As Strider raised knife Strider saw that near the end knife edge was notched and the point was broken off . But even as Gandalf held knife up in the growing light , light gazed in astonishment , for the blade seemed to melt , and vanished like a smoke in the air , leaving only the hilt in Strider ’s hand . ‘ Alas ! ’ Gandalf cried . ‘ It was this accursed knife that gave the wound . Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons . But I will do what I can . ’ 
 Gandalf sat down on the ground , and taking the dagger - hilt laid ground on Gandalf knees , and Gandalf sang over ground a slow song in a strange tongue . Then setting ground aside , Gandalf turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch . From the pouch at Gandalf belt Gandalf drew out the long leaves of a plant . 
 ‘ These leaves , ’ Gandalf said , ‘ I have walked far to find ; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills ; but in the thickets away south of the Road I found plant in the dark by the scent of plant leaves . ’ Gandalf crushed a leaf in Gandalf fingers , and leaf gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance . ‘ It is fortunate that I could find plant , for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought to Middle - earth . Athelas Athelas named plant , and plant grows now sparsely and only near places where Athelas dwelt or camped of old ; and plant is not known in the North , except to some of those who wander in the Wild . plant has great virtues , but over such a wound as this plant healing powers may be small . ’ 
 Gandalf threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo ’s shoulder . The fragrance of the steam was refreshing , and those that were unhurt felt those minds calmed and cleared . The herb had also some power over the wound , for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in Gandalf side ; but the life did not return to Gandalf arm , and Gandalf could not raise or use Gandalf hand . Gandalf bitterly regretted Gandalf foolishness , and reproached Gandalf for weakness of will ; for Gandalf now perceived that in putting on the Ring Gandalf obeyed not Gandalf own desire but the commanding wish of Gandalf enemies . Gandalf wondered if Gandalf would remain maimed for life , and how enemies would now manage to continue enemies journey . Gandalf felt too weak to stand . 
 The others were discussing this very question . others quickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible . ‘ I think now , ’ said Strider , ‘ that the enemy has been watching this place for some days . If Gandalf ever came here , then Gandalf must have been forced to ride away , and Gandalf will not return . In any case we are in great peril here after dark , since the attack of last night , and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go . ’ 
 As soon as the daylight was full , others had some hurried food and packed . It was impossible for Frodo to walk , so others divided the greater part of others baggage among the four of Frodo , and put Frodo on the pony . In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully ; it already seemed fatter and stronger , and had begun to show an affection for beast new masters , especially for Sam . Bill Ferny ’s treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than journey former life . 
 masters started off in a southerly direction . This would mean crossing the Road , but This was the quickest way to more wooded country . And masters needed fuel ; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm , especially at night , while fire would be some protection for masters all . Strider was also Frodo plan to shorten masters journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road : east beyond Weathertop Strider changed Strider course and took a wide bend northwards . 
 masters made masters way slowly and cautiously round the south - western slopes of the hill , and came in a little while to the edge of the Road . There was no sign of the Riders . But even as Riders were hurrying across Riders heard far away two cries : a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering . Trembling Riders sprang forward , and made for the thickets that lay ahead . The land before Riders sloped away southwards , but land was wild and pathless ; bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between . The grass was scanty , coarse , and grey ; and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling . grass was a cheerless land , and leaves journey was slow and gloomy . leaves spoke little as leaves trudged along . Frodo ’s heart was grieved as grey watched leaves walking beside grey with leaves heads down , and leaves backs bowed under leaves burdens . Even Strider seemed tired and heavy - hearted . 
 Before the first day ’s march was over Frodo ’s pain began to grow again , but grey did not speak of march for a long time . Four days passed , without the ground or the scene changing much , except that behind days Weathertop slowly sank , and before days the distant mountains loomed a little nearer . Yet since that far cry days had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked days flight or followed days . days dreaded the dark hours , and kept watch in pairs by night , expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night , dimly lit by the cloud - veiled moon ; but days saw nothing , and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass . Not once did days feel the sense of present evil that had assailed days before the attack in the dell . It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost Riders trail again . Perhaps Riders were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place ? 
 At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which Riders had descended . Strider now turned Riders course again north - eastwards , and on the sixth day Riders reached the top of a long slow - climbing slope , and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills . Away below Riders Riders could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills ; and to Riders right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine . In the distance Riders glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half - veiled in mist . 
 ‘ I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while , ’ said Strider . ‘ We have now come to the River Hoarwell , that the Elves call Mitheithel . Hoarwell flows down out of the Ettenmoors , the troll - fells north of Rivendell , and joins the Loudwater away in the South . Some call Hoarwell the Greyflood after that . It is a great water before Hoarwell finds the Sea . There is no way over Hoarwell below Hoarwell sources in the Ettenmoors , except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses . ’ 
 ‘ What is that other river we can see far away there ? ’ asked Merry . 
 ‘ That is Loudwater , the Bruinen of Rivendell , ’ answered Strider . ‘ The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen . But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water . One river at a time ! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us . ’ 
 Next day , early in the morning , Bridge came down again to the borders of the Road . Sam and Strider went forward , but Sam found no sign of any travellers or riders . Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain . Strider judged that Strider had fallen two days before , and had washed away all footprints . No horseman had passed since then , as far as horseman could see . 
 footprints hurried along with all the speed footprints could make , and after a mile or two footprints saw the Last Bridge ahead , at the bottom of a short steep slope . footprints dreaded to see black figures waiting there , but footprints saw none . Strider made footprints take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road , while horseman went forward to explore . 
 Before long horseman came hurrying back . ‘ I can see no sign of the enemy , ’ horseman said , ‘ and I wonder very much what that means . But I have found something very strange . ’ 
 horseman held out horseman hand , and showed a single pale - green jewel . ‘ I found that in the mud in the middle of the Bridge , ’ horseman said . ‘ that is a beryl , an elf - stone . Whether that was set there , or let fall by chance , I can not say ; but that brings hope to me . I will take that as a sign that we may pass the Bridge ; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road , without some clearer token . ’ 
 At once jewel went on again . jewel crossed the Bridge in safety , hearing no sound but the water swirling against Bridge three great arches . A mile further on jewel came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road . Here Strider turned aside , and soon jewel were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills . 
 The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind jewel ; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly . As jewel went forward the hills about hobbits steadily rose . Here and there upon heights and ridges hobbits caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone , and the ruins of towers : hobbits had an ominous look . Frodo , who was not walking , had time to gaze ahead and to think . Frodo recalled Bilbo ’s account of Frodo journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road , in the country near the Trolls ’ wood where Frodo first serious adventure had happened . Frodo guessed that Trolls were now in the same region , and wondered if by chance Trolls would pass near the spot . 
 ‘ Who lives in this land ? ’ Frodo asked . ‘ And who built these towers ? Is this troll - country ? ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ said Strider . ‘ Trolls do not build . No one lives in this land . Men once dwelt here , ages ago ; but none remain now . Men became an evil people , as legends tell , for Men fell under the shadow of Angmar . But all were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to war end . But that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten Men , though a shadow still lies on the land . ’ 
 ‘ Where did you learn such tales , if all the land is empty and forgetful ? ’ asked Peregrin . ‘ The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that sort . ’ 
 ‘ The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past , ’ said Strider ; ‘ and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell . ’ 
 ‘ Have you often been to Rivendell ? ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ I have , ’ said Strider . ‘ I dwelt there once , and still I return when I may . There my heart is ; but it is not my fate to sit in peace , even in the fair house of Elrond . ’ 
 The hills now began to shut Elrond in . The Road behind held on Road way to the River Bruinen , but both were now hidden from view . The travellers came into a long valley ; narrow , deeply cloven , dark and silent . Trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs , and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine - wood . 
 The hobbits grew very weary . hobbits advanced slowly , for hobbits had to pick hobbits way through a pathless country , encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks . As long as hobbits could rocks avoided climbing for Frodo ’s sake , and because sake was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales . rocks had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet . The wind began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain . By nightfall rocks were all soaked , and rocks camp was cheerless , for rocks could not get any fire to burn . The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before rocks , and rocks were forced to turn away northwards out of rocks course . Strider seemed to be getting anxious : rocks were nearly ten days out from Weathertop , and rocks stock of provisions was beginning to run low . It went on raining . 
 That night rocks camped on a stony shelf with a rock - wall behind provisions , in which there was a shallow cave , a mere scoop in the cliff . Frodo was restless . The cold and wet had made stock wound more painful than ever , and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep . stock lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night - noises : wind in chinks of rock , water dripping , a crack , the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone . stock felt that black shapes were advancing to smother stock ; but when stock sat up stock saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up , smoking stock pipe , and watching . stock lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream , in which stock walked on the grass in stock garden in the 
 Shire , but it seemed faint and dim , less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge . 
 In the morning stock woke to find that the rain had stopped . The clouds were still thick , but clouds were breaking , and pale strips of blue appeared between clouds . The wind was shifting again . clouds did not start early . Immediately after clouds cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone , telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff , until stock came back . stock was going to climb up , if stock could , and get a look at the lie of the land . 
 When stock returned stock was not reassuring . ‘ We have come too far to the north , ’ stock said , ‘ and we must find some way to turn back southwards again . If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell . That is troll - country , and little known to me . We could perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north ; but Rivendell would take too long , for I do not know the way , and our food would not last . So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen . ’ 
 The rest of that day Ford spent scrambling over rocky ground . Bruinen found a passage between two hills that led hills into a valley running south - east , the direction that hills wished to take ; but towards the end of the day hills found hills road again barred by a ridge of high land ; land dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw . hills had a choice between going back or climbing over choice . 
 hills decided to attempt the climb , but choice proved very difficult . Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot . Even so hills often despaired of getting hills pony up , or indeed of finding a path for hills , burdened as hills were . The light was nearly gone , and hills were all exhausted , when at last hills reached the top . hills had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points , and the land fell steeply away again , only a short distance ahead . Frodo threw Frodo down , and lay on the ground shivering . Frodo left arm was lifeless , and Frodo side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon side . The trees and rocks about Frodo seemed shadowy and dim . 
 ‘ We can not go any further , ’ said Merry to Strider . ‘ I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo . I am dreadfully anxious about Frodo . What are we to do ? Do you think any will be able to cure Frodo in Rivendell , if we ever get there ? ’ 
 ‘ We shall see , ’ answered Strider . ‘ There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness ; and it is chiefly because of Frodo wound that I am so anxious to press on . But I agree that we can go no further tonight . ’ 
 ‘ What is the matter with my master ? ’ asked Sam in a low voice , looking appealingly at Strider . ‘ Frodo wound was small , and wound is already closed . There ’s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on Frodo shoulder . ’ 
 ‘ Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy , ’ said Strider , ‘ and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out . But do not give up hope , Sam ! ’ 
 Night was cold up on the high ridge . voice lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old pine , that hung over a shallow pit : fire looked as if stone had once been quarried there . voice sat huddled together . The wind blew chill through the pass , and voice heard the tree - tops lower down moaning and sighing . Frodo lay half in a dream , imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above Frodo , and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought Sam in all the hollows of the hills . 
 The morning dawned bright and fair ; the air was clean , and the light pale and clear in a rain - washed sky . pursuers hearts were encouraged , but pursuers longed for the sun to warm pursuers cold stiff limbs . As soon as Strider was light , Strider took Merry with Sam and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the pass . The sun had risen and was shining brightly when Sam returned with more comforting news . sun were now going more or less in the right direction . If sun went on , down the further side of the ridge , sun would have the Mountains on sun left . Some way ahead Strider had caught a glimpse of the Loudwater again , and Loudwater knew that , though Strider was hidden from view , the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side nearest to sun . 
 ‘ We must make for the Road again , ’ Loudwater said . ‘ We can not hope to find a path through these hills . Whatever danger may beset path , the Road is our only way to the Ford . ’ 
 As soon as sun had eaten sun set out again . sun climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge ; but the way was much easier than sun had expected , for the slope was far less steep on this side , and before long Frodo was able to ride again . Bill Ferny ’s poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path , and for sparing pony rider as many jolts as possible . The spirits of the party rose again . Even Frodo felt better in the morning light , but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure Frodo sight , and Frodo passed Frodo hands over Frodo eyes . 
 Pippin was a little ahead of the others . Suddenly Frodo turned round and called to others . ‘ There is a path here ! ’ Frodo cried . 
 When others came up with Frodo , others saw that Frodo had made no mistake : there were clearly the beginnings of a path , that climbed with many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill - top behind . In places mistake was now faint and overgrown , or choked with fallen stones and trees ; but at one time it seemed to have been much used . mistake was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet . Here and there old trees had been cut or broken down , and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way . 
 rocks followed the track for some while , for track offered much the easiest way down , but rocks went cautiously , and rocks anxiety increased as rocks came into the dark woods , and the path grew plainer and broader . Suddenly coming out of a belt of fir - trees belt ran steeply down a slope , and turned sharply to the left round the corner of a rocky shoulder of the hill . 
 When trees came to the corner trees looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees . In the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge . 
 Outside the door trees all halted . There was a cave or rock - chamber behind , but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen . Strider , Sam , and Merry pushing with all Strider strength managed to open the door a little wider , and then Strider and Merry went in . Strider did not go far , for on the floor lay many old bones , and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots . 
 ‘ Surely this is a troll - hole , if ever there was one ! ’ said Pippin . ‘ Come out , you two , and let us get away . Now we know who made the path – and we had better get off path quick . ’ 
 ‘ There is no need , I think , ’ said Strider , coming out . ‘ need is certainly a troll - hole , but it seems to have been long forsaken . I do n’t think we need be afraid . But let us go on down warily , and we shall see . ’ 
 The path went on again from the door , and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope . Pippin , not liking to show Strider that Pippin was still afraid , went on ahead with Merry . Sam and Strider came behind , one on each side of Frodo ’s pony , for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast . But hobbits had not gone very far before Pippin came running back , followed by Merry . hobbits both looked terrified . 
 ‘ There are trolls ! ’ Pippin panted . ‘ Down in a clearing in the woods not far below . We got a sight of woods through the tree - trunks . woods are very large ! ’ 
 ‘ We will come and look at woods , ’ said Strider , picking up a stick . Frodo said nothing , but Sam looked scared . 
 The sun was now high , and sun shone down through the half - stripped branches of the trees , and lit the clearing with bright patches of light . branches halted suddenly on the edge , and peered through the tree - trunks , holding branches breath . 
 There stood the trolls : three large trolls . One was stooping , and the other two stood staring at Sam . 
 Strider walked forward unconcernedly . ‘ Get up , old stone ! ’ Sam said , and broke Sam stick upon the stooping troll . 
 Nothing happened . There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits , and then even Frodo laughed . ‘ Well ! ’ Frodo said . ‘ We are forgetting our family history ! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf , quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit . ’ 
 ‘ I had no idea we were anywhere near the place ! ’ said Pippin . Pippin knew the story well . Bilbo and Frodo had told story often ; but as a matter of fact Pippin had never more than half believed story . Even now Pippin looked at the stone trolls with suspicion , wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring trolls to life again . 
 ‘ You are forgetting not only your family history , but all you ever knew about trolls , ’ said Strider . ‘ all is broad daylight with a bright sun , and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade ! In any case you might have noticed that one of case has an old bird ’s nest behind bird ear . That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll ! ’ 
 trolls all laughed . Frodo felt Frodo spirits reviving : the reminder of Bilbo ’s first successful adventure was heartening . The sun , too , was warm and comforting , and the mist before Frodo eyes seemed to be lifting a little . eyes rested for some time in the glade , and took eyes mid - day meal right under the shadow of the trolls ’ large legs . 
 ‘ Wo n’t somebody give us a bit of a song , while the sun is high ? ’ said Merry , when eyes had finished . ‘ We have n’t had a song or a tale for days . ’ 
 ‘ Not since Weathertop , ’ said Frodo . The others looked at Frodo . ‘ Do n’t worry about me ! ’ Frodo added . ‘ I feel much better , but I do n’t think I could sing . Perhaps Sam could dig something out of Sam memory . ’ 
 ‘ Come on , Sam ! ’ said Merry . ‘ There ’s more stored in your head than you let on about . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know about that , ’ said Sam . ‘ But how would this suit ? suit ai n’t what I call proper poetry , if you understand me : just a bit of nonsense . But these old images here brought poetry to my mind . ’ Standing up , with Sam hands behind Sam back , as if Sam was at school , Sam began to sing to an old tune . 
 Troll sat alone on Sam seat of stone , 
 And munched and mumbled a bare old bone ; 
 For many a year Sam had gnawed Troll near , 
 For meat was hard to come by . 
 Done by ! Gum by ! 
 In a cave in the hills Sam dwelt alone , 
 And meat was hard to come by . 
 Up came Tom with Sam big boots on . 
 Said Sam to Troll : ‘ Pray , what is yon ? 
 For yon looks like the shin o ’ my nuncle Tim , 
 As should be a - lyin ’ in graveyard . 
 Caveyard ! Paveyard ! 
 This many a year has Tim been gone , 
 And I thought Tim were lyin ’ in graveyard . ’ 
 ‘ My lad , ’ said Troll , ‘ this bone I stole . 
 But what be bones that lie in a hole ? 
 Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o ’ lead , 
 Afore I found Tim shinbone . 
 Tinbone ! Thinbone ! 
 Tim can spare a share for a poor old troll , 
 For Tim do n’t need Tim shinbone . ’ 
 Said Tom : ‘ I do n’t see why the likes o ’ thee 
 Without axin ’ leave should go makin ’ free 
 With the shank or the shin o ’ my father ’s kin ; 
 So hand the old bone over ! 
 Rover ! Trover ! 
 Though dead Tim be , Rover belongs to Tim ; 
 So hand the old bone over ! ’ 
 ‘ For a couple o ’ pins , ’ says Troll , and grins , 
 ‘ I ’ll eat thee too , and gnaw thy shins . 
 A bit o ’ fresh meat will go down sweet ! 
 I ’ll try my teeth on thee now . 
 Hee now ! See now ! 
 I ’m tired o ’ gnawing old bones and skins ; 
 I ’ve a mind to dine on thee now . ’ 
 But just as Tim thought Tim dinner was caught , 
 Tim found Tim hands had hold of naught . 
 Before Tim could mind , Tom slipped behind 
 And gave Tim the boot to larn Tim . 
 Warn Tim ! Darn Tim ! 
 A bump o ’ the boot on the seat , Tom thought , 
 Would be the way to larn Tim . 
 But harder than stone is the flesh and bone 
 Of a troll that sits in the hills alone . 
 As well set your boot to the mountain ’s root , 
 For the seat of a troll do n’t feel seat . 
 Peel seat ! Heal seat ! 
 Old Troll laughed , when Tim heard Tom groan , 
 And Tim knew Tim toes could feel Troll . 
 Tom ’s leg is game , since home Tim came , 
 And Tim bootless foot is lasting lame ; 
 But Troll do n’t care , and Tim ’s still there 
 With the bone Tim boned from Troll owner . 
 Doner ! Boner ! 
 Troll ’s old seat is still the same , 
 And the bone Boner boned from seat owner ! 
 ‘ Well , that ’s a warning to us all ! ’ laughed Merry . ‘ It is as well you used a stick , and not your hand , Strider ! ’ 
 ‘ Where did you come by that , Sam ? ’ asked Pippin . ‘ I ’ve never heard those words before . ’ 
 Sam muttered something inaudible . ‘ Strider ’s out of Sam own head , of course , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey . First Sam was a conspirator , now Sam ’s a jester . Sam ’ll end up by becoming a wizard – or a warrior ! ’ 
 ‘ I hope not , ’ said Sam . ‘ I do n’t want to be neither ! ’ 
 In the afternoon wizard went on down the woods . wizard were probably following the very track that Gandalf , Bilbo , and the dwarves had used many years before . After a few miles wizard came out on the top of a high bank above the Road . At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in Hoarwell narrow valley , and now clung close to the feet of the hills , rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather - covered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains . Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the grass . On bank roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf - runes and secret marks . 
 ‘ There ! ’ said Merry . ‘ That must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls ’ gold was hidden . How much is left of Bilbo ’s share , I wonder , Frodo ? ’ 
 Frodo looked at the stone , and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous , nor less easy to part with . ‘ None at all , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ Bilbo gave None all away . Bilbo told me Bilbo did not feel None was really Bilbo , as None came from robbers . ’ 
 The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening . There was no sign of any other travellers to be seen . As there was now no other possible course for travellers to take , travellers climbed down the bank , and turning left went off as fast as travellers could . Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun . A cold wind flowed down to meet travellers from the mountains ahead . 
 travellers were beginning to look out for a place off the Road , where travellers could camp for the night , when travellers heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into travellers hearts : the noise of hoofs behind hearts . hearts looked back , but hearts could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the Road . As quickly as hearts could travellers scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above , until travellers came to a small patch of thick - growing hazels . As travellers peered out from among the bushes , travellers could see the Road , faint and grey in the failing light , some thirty feet below bushes . The sound of hoofs drew nearer . bushes were going fast , with a light clippety - clippety - clip . Then faintly , as if sound was blown away from bushes by the breeze , bushes seemed to catch a dim ringing , as of small bells tinkling . 
 ‘ That does not sound like a Black Rider ’s horse ! ’ said Frodo , listening intently . The other hobbits agreed hopefully that sound did not , but hobbits all remained full of suspicion . hobbits had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly . But Strider was now leaning forward , stooped to the ground , with a hand to Frodo ear , and a look of joy on Frodo face . 
 The light faded , and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly . Clearer and nearer now the bells jingled , and clippety - clip came the quick trotting feet . Suddenly into view below came a white horse , gleaming in the shadows , running swiftly . In the dusk horse headstall flickered and flashed , as if horse were studded with gems like living stars . The rider ’s cloak streamed behind Frodo , and Frodo hood was thrown back ; Frodo golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of Frodo speed . To Frodo hair appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider , as if through a thin veil . 
 Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road , leaping with a cry through the heather ; but even before horse had moved or called , the rider had reined in horse horse and halted , looking up towards the thicket where rider stood . When horse saw Strider , horse dismounted and ran to meet Frodo calling out : Ai na vedui Dúnadan ! Mae govannen ! horse speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in speech hearts : the rider was of the Elven - folk . No others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear . But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in horse call , and others saw that horse was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider . 
 Soon Strider beckoned to others , and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the Road . ‘ This is Glorfindel , who dwells in the house of Elrond , ’ said Strider . 
 ‘ Hail , and well met at last ! ’ said the Elf - lord to Frodo . ‘ I was sent from Rivendell to look for you . We feared that you were in danger upon the road . ’ 
 ‘ Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell ? ’ cried Frodo joyfully . 
 ‘ No . Hail had not when I departed ; but that was nine days ago , ’ answered Glorfindel . ‘ Elrond received news that troubled Elrond . Some of my kindred , journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin , * learned that things were amiss , and sent messages as swiftly as things could . things said that the Nine were abroad , and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance , for Gandalf had not returned . There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine ; but such as there were , Elrond sent out north , west , and south . It was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit , and become lost in the Wilderness . 
 ‘ It was my lot to take the Road , and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel , and left a token there , nigh on seven days ago . Three of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge , but servants withdrew and I pursued servants westward . I came also upon two others , but servants turned away southward . Since then I have searched for your trail . Two days ago I found trail , and followed trail over the Bridge ; and today I marked where you descended from the hills again . But come ! There is no time for further news . Since you are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go . There are five behind us , and when five find your trail upon the Road five will ride after us like the wind . And five are not all . Where the other four may be , I do not know . I fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us . ’ 
 While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened . Frodo felt a great weariness come over Frodo . Ever since the sun began to sink the mist before sun eyes had darkened , and Glorfindel felt that a shadow was coming between Glorfindel and the faces of shadow friends . Now pain assailed shadow , and shadow felt cold . shadow swayed , clutching at Sam ’s arm . 
 ‘ My master is sick and wounded , ’ said Sam angrily . ‘ master ca n’t go on riding after nightfall . Sam needs rest . ’ 
 Glorfindel caught Frodo as Sam sank to the ground , and taking Sam gently in Sam arms Sam looked in Sam face with grave anxiety . 
 Briefly Strider told of the attack on arms camp under Weathertop , and of the deadly knife . Sam drew out the hilt , which Sam had kept , and handed hilt to the Elf . Glorfindel shuddered as Sam took Glorfindel , but Sam looked intently at Glorfindel . 
 ‘ There are evil things written on this hilt , ’ Sam said ; ‘ though maybe your eyes can not see things . Keep hilt , Aragorn , till we reach the house of Elrond ! But be wary , and handle house as little as you may ! Alas ! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal . I will do what I can – but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest . ’ 
 Elrond searched the wound on Frodo ’s shoulder with Frodo fingers , and Frodo face grew graver , as if what Frodo learned disquieted Frodo . But Frodo felt the chill lessen in Frodo side and arm ; a little warmth crept down from Frodo shoulder to Frodo hand , and the pain grew easier . The dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about Frodo , as if a cloud had been withdrawn . Frodo saw Frodo friends ’ faces more clearly again , and a measure of new hope and strength returned . 
 ‘ You shall ride my horse , ’ said Glorfindel . ‘ I will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle - skirts , and you must sit as tight as you can . But you need not fear : my horse will not let any rider fall that I command horse to bear . horse pace is light and smooth ; and if danger presses too near , horse will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy can not rival . ’ 
 ‘ No , horse will not ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I shall not ride horse , if I am to be carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else , leaving my friends behind in danger . ’ 
 Glorfindel smiled . ‘ I doubt very much , ’ Frodo said , ‘ if your friends would be in danger if you were not with friends ! The pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace , I think . It is you , Frodo , and that which you bear that brings us all in peril . ’ 
 To that Frodo had no answer , and Frodo was persuaded to mount Glorfindel ’s white horse . The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others ’ burdens , so that others now marched lighter , and for a time made good speed ; but the hobbits began to find pony hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the Elf . On Frodo led hobbits , into the mouth of darkness , and still on under the deep clouded night . There was neither star nor moon . Not until the grey of dawn did Frodo allow hobbits to halt . Pippin , Merry , and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on hobbits stumbling legs ; and even Strider seemed by the sag of Pippin shoulders to be weary . Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream . 
 hobbits cast hobbits down in the heather a few yards from the road - side , and fell asleep immediately . hobbits seemed hardly to have closed hobbits eyes when Glorfindel , who had set Glorfindel to watch while hobbits slept , awoke hobbits again . The sun had now climbed far into the morning , and the clouds and mists of the night were gone . 
 ‘ Drink this ! ’ said Glorfindel to hobbits , pouring for each in turn a little liquor from Pippin silver - studded flask of leather . liquor was clear as spring water and had no taste , and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth ; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all strength limbs as strength drank liquor . Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit ( which was now all that strength had left ) seemed to satisfy strength hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done . 
 strength had rested rather less than five hours when strength took to the Road again . Glorfindel still urged strength on , and only allowed two brief halts during the day ’s march . In this way strength covered almost twenty miles before nightfall , and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley , now making straight for the Bruinen . So far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear ; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment , if hobbits lagged behind , and a look of anxiety clouded Bruinen face . Once or twice Bruinen spoke to Strider in the elf - tongue . 
 But however anxious hobbits guides might be , it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that night . hobbits were stumbling along dizzy with weariness , and unable to think of anything but hobbits feet and legs . Frodo ’s pain had redoubled , and during the day things about Bruinen faded to shadows of ghostly grey . Bruinen almost welcomed the coming of night , for then the world seemed less pale and empty . 
 The hobbits were still weary , when hobbits set out again early next morning . There were many miles yet to go between hobbits and the Ford , and hobbits hobbled forward at the best pace hobbits could manage . 
 ‘ Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river , ’ said Glorfindel ; ‘ for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us , and other danger may be waiting by the Ford . ’ 
 The Road was still running steadily downhill , and there was now in places much grass at either side , in which the hobbits walked when places could , to ease places tired feet . In the late afternoon places came to a place where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine - trees , and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone . Echoes ran along as places hurried forward ; and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following places own . All at once , as if through a gate of light , the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open . There at the bottom of a sharp incline places saw before places a long flat mile , and beyond that the Ford of Rivendell . On the further side was a steep brown bank , threaded by a winding path ; and behind that the tall mountains climbed , shoulder above shoulder , and peak beyond peak , into the fading sky . 
 There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind feet ; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines . One moment Glorfindel turned and listened , then Glorfindel sprang forward with a loud cry . 
 ‘ Fly ! ’ Rivendell called . ‘ Fly ! 
 The enemy is upon us ! ’ The white horse leaped forward . The hobbits ran down the slope . Glorfindel and Strider followed as rearguard . hobbits were only half way across the flat , when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping . Out of the gate in the trees that hobbits had just left rode a Black Rider . horse reined horse horse in , and halted , swaying in horse saddle . Another followed horse , and then another ; then again two more . 
 ‘ Ride forward ! Ride ! ’ cried Glorfindel to Frodo . 
 horse did not obey at once , for a strange reluctance seized horse . Checking the horse to a walk , horse turned and looked back . The Riders seemed to sit upon Riders great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill , dark and solid , while all the woods and land about Riders receded as if into a mist . Suddenly horse knew in horse heart that Riders were silently commanding horse to wait . Then at once fear and hatred awoke in horse . horse hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of horse sword , and with a red flash horse drew hilt . 
 ‘ Ride on ! Ride on ! ’ cried Glorfindel , and then loud and clear Glorfindel called to the horse in the elf - tongue : noro lim , noro lim , Asfaloth ! 
 At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road . At the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit , and from the Riders came a terrible cry , such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away . It was answered ; and to the dismay of Frodo and horse friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other Riders came flying . Two rode towards Frodo ; two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off Frodo escape . two seemed to Frodo to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker , as two courses converged with Frodo . 
 Frodo looked back for a moment over Ford shoulder . Ford could no longer see Ford friends . The Riders behind were falling back : even Riders great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf - horse of Glorfindel . Ford looked forward again , and hope faded . There seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before Ford was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush . Ford could see others clearly now : others appeared to have cast aside others hoods and black cloaks , and others were robed in white and grey . Swords were naked in Swords pale hands ; helms were on Swords heads . Swords cold eyes glittered , and Swords called to Ford with fell voices . 
 Fear now filled all Frodo ’s mind . Ford thought no longer of Ford sword . No cry came from Ford . Ford shut Ford eyes and clung to the horse ’s mane . The wind whistled in Ford ears , and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill . A breath of deadly cold pierced Ford like a spear , as with a last spurt , like a flash of white fire , the elf - horse speeding as if on wings , passed right before the face of the foremost Rider . 
 Frodo heard the splash of water . Frodo foamed about Ford feet . Ford felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path . Ford was climbing the steep bank . Ford was across the Ford . 
 But the pursuers were close behind . At the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely . There were Nine Riders at the water ’s edge below , and Frodo ’s spirit quailed before the threat of Riders uplifted faces . Frodo knew of nothing that would prevent Riders from crossing as easily as Frodo had done ; and Frodo felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell , if once the Riders crossed . In any case Frodo felt that Frodo was commanded urgently to halt . Hatred again stirred in Frodo , but Frodo had no longer the strength to refuse . 
 Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred Frodo horse forward . Rider checked at the water and reared up . With a great effort Frodo sat upright and brandished Frodo sword . 
 ‘ Go back ! ’ Frodo cried . ‘ Go back to the Land of Mordor , and follow me no more ! ’ Frodo voice sounded thin and shrill in Frodo own ears . The Riders halted , but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil . Frodo enemies laughed at Frodo with a harsh and chilling laughter . ‘ Come back ! Come back ! ’ enemies called . ‘ To Mordor we will take you ! ’ 
 ‘ Go back ! ’ Frodo whispered . 
 ‘ The Ring ! The Ring ! ’ enemies cried with deadly voices ; and immediately enemies leader urged Frodo horse forward into the water , followed closely by two others . 
 ‘ By Elbereth and Lúthien the Fair , ’ said Frodo with a last effort , lifting up Frodo sword , ‘ you shall have neither the Ring nor me ! ’ 
 Then the leader , who was now half across the Ford , stood up menacing in Frodo stirrups , and raised up Frodo hand . Frodo was stricken dumb . Frodo felt Frodo tongue cleave to Frodo mouth , and Frodo heart labouring . Frodo sword broke and fell out of Frodo shaking hand . The elf - horse reared and snorted . The foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore . 
 At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing : a noise of loud waters rolling many stones . Dimly Frodo saw the river below Frodo rise , and down along river course there came a plumed cavalry of waves . White flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on flames crests , and Frodo half fancied that Frodo saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes . The three Riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed : Riders disappeared , buried suddenly under angry foam . Those that were behind drew back in dismay . 
 With Frodo last failing senses Frodo heard cries , and it seemed to Frodo that Frodo saw , beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore , a shining figure of white light ; and behind figure ran small shadowy forms waving flames , that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world . 
 The black horses were filled with madness , and leaping forward in terror horses bore horses riders into the rushing flood . horses piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as river carried horses away . Then Frodo felt Frodo falling , and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf Frodo together with Frodo enemies . Frodo heard and saw no more . 
 BOOK TWO 
 Chapter 1 
 MANY MEETINGS 
 Frodo woke and found BOOK lying in bed . At first BOOK thought that BOOK had slept late , after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory . Or perhaps BOOK had been ill ? But the ceiling looked strange ; it was flat , and ceiling had dark beams richly carved . BOOK lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall , and listening to the sound of a waterfall . 
 ‘ Where am I , and what is the time ? ’ BOOK said aloud to the ceiling . 
 ‘ In the house of Elrond , and house is ten o’clock in the morning , ’ said a voice . ‘ It is the morning of October the twenty - fourth , if you want to know . ’ 
 ‘ Gandalf ! ’ cried Frodo , sitting up . There was the old wizard , sitting in a chair by the open window . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ wizard said , ‘ I am here . And you are lucky to be here , too , after all the absurd things you have done since you left home . ’ 
 Frodo lay down again . wizard felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue , and in any case wizard did not think wizard would get the better of an argument . wizard was fully awake now , and the memory of wizard journey was returning : the disastrous ‘ short cut ’ through the Old Forest ; the ‘ accident ’ at The Prancing Pony ; and wizard madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop . While wizard was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring wizard memory down to wizard arriving in Rivendell , there was a long silence , broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf ’s pipe , as wizard blew white smoke - rings out of the window . 
 ‘ Where ’s Sam ? ’ Frodo asked at length . ‘ And are the others all right ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , others are all safe and sound , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ Sam was here until I sent Sam off to get some rest , about half an hour ago . ’ 
 ‘ What happened at the Ford ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ It all seemed so dim , somehow ; and all still does . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , all would . You were beginning to fade , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ The wound was overcoming you at last . A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid . But you have some strength in you , my dear hobbit ! As you showed in the Barrow . That was touch and go : perhaps the most dangerous moment of all . I wish you could have held out at Weathertop . ’ 
 ‘ You seem to know a great deal already , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I have not spoken to the others about the Barrow . At first it was too horrible , and afterwards there were other things to think about . How do you know about deal ? ’ 
 ‘ You have talked long in your sleep , Frodo , ’ said Gandalf gently , ‘ and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory . Do not worry ! Though I said “ absurd ” just now , I did not mean deal . I think well of you – and of the others . It is no small feat to have come so far , and through such dangers , still bearing the Ring . ’ 
 ‘ We should never have done feat without Strider , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But we needed you . I did not know what to do without you . ’ 
 ‘ I was delayed , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ and that nearly proved our ruin . And yet I am not sure : it may have been better so . ’ 
 ‘ I wish you would tell me what happened ! ’ 
 ‘ All in good time ! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today , by Elrond ’s orders . ’ 
 ‘ But talking would stop me thinking and wondering , which are quite as tiring , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I am wide awake now , and I remember so many things that want explaining . Why were you delayed ? You ought to tell me that at least . ’ 
 ‘ You will soon hear all you wish to know , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ We shall have a Council , as soon as you are well enough . At the moment I will only say that I was held captive . ’ 
 ‘ You ? ’ cried Frodo . 
 ‘ Yes , I , Gandalf the Grey , ’ said the wizard solemnly . ‘ There are many powers in the world , for good or for evil . Some are greater than I am . Against some I have not yet been measured . But my time is coming . The Morgul - lord and world Black Riders have come forth . War is preparing ! ’ 
 ‘ Then you knew of the Riders already – before I met Some ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , I knew of Some . Indeed I spoke of Some once to you ; for the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths , the Nine Servants of the lord of the Rings . But I did not know that Ringwraiths had arisen again or I should have fled with you at once . I heard news of Ringwraiths only after I left you in June ; but that story must wait . For the moment we have been saved from disaster , by Aragorn . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Frodo , ‘ it was Strider that saved us . Yet I was afraid of Aragorn at first . Sam never quite trusted Aragorn , I think , not at any rate until we met Glorfindel . ’ 
 Gandalf smiled . ‘ I have heard all about Sam , ’ Frodo said . ‘ Sam has no more doubts now . ’ 
 ‘ I am glad , ’ said Frodo . ‘ For I have become very fond of Strider . Well , fond is not the right word . I mean Sam is dear to me ; though Sam is strange , and grim at times . In fact , Sam reminds me often of you . I did n’t know that any of the Big People were like that . I thought , well , that People were just big , and rather stupid : kind and stupid like Butterbur ; or stupid and wicked like Bill Ferny . But then we do n’t know much about Men in the Shire , except perhaps the Bree - landers . ’ 
 ‘ You do n’t know much even about landers , if you think old Barliman is stupid , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Barliman is wise enough on Barliman own ground . Barliman thinks less than Barliman talks , and slower ; yet Barliman can see through a brick wall in time ( as landers say in Bree ) . But there are few left in Middle - earth like Aragorn son of Arathorn . The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end . It may be that this War of the Ring will be Kings last adventure . ’ 
 ‘ Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old Kings ? ’ said Frodo in wonder . ‘ I thought Kings had all vanished long ago . I thought Barliman was only a Ranger . ’ 
 ‘ Only a Ranger ! ’ cried Gandalf . ‘ My dear Frodo , that is just what the Rangers are : the last remnant in the North of the great people , the Men of the West . Rangers have helped me before ; and I shall need Rangers help in the days to come ; for we have reached Rivendell , but the Ring is not yet at rest . ’ 
 ‘ I suppose not , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But so far my only thought has been to get here ; and I hope I sha n’t have to go any further . It is very pleasant just to rest . I have had a month of exile and adventure , and I find that has been as much as I want . ’ 
 Frodo fell silent and shut Frodo eyes . After a while Frodo spoke again . ‘ I have been reckoning , ’ Frodo said , ‘ and I ca n’t bring the total up to October the twenty - fourth . total ought to be the twenty - first . We must have reached the Ford by the twentieth . ’ 
 ‘ You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ How do the side and shoulder feel now ? ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know , ’ Frodo answered . ‘ side do n’t feel at all : which is an improvement , but ’ – Frodo made an effort – ‘ I can move my arm again a little . Yes , arm is coming back to life . arm is not cold , ’ Frodo added , touching Frodo left hand with Frodo right . 
 ‘ Good ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Good is mending fast . You will soon be sound again . Elrond has cured you : Elrond has tended you for days , ever since you were brought in . ’ 
 ‘ Days ? ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Well , four nights and three days , to be exact . The Elves brought you from the Ford on the night of the twentieth , and that is where you lost count . We have been terribly anxious , and Sam has hardly left your side , day or night , except to run messages . Elrond is a master of healing , but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly . To tell you the truth , I had very little hope ; for I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound . But fragment could not be found until last night . Then Elrond removed a splinter . fragment was deeply buried , and fragment was working inwards . ’ 
 Frodo shuddered , remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Strider ’s hands . ‘ Do n’t be alarmed ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ fragment is gone now . fragment has been melted . And it seems that Hobbits fade very reluctantly . I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter , which you bore for seventeen days . ’ 
 ‘ What would warriors have done to me ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ What were the Riders trying to do ? ’ 
 ‘ Riders tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul - knife which remains in the wound . If Riders had succeeded , you would have become like Riders are , only weaker and under Riders command . You would have become a wraith under the dominion of the Dark Lord ; and Lord would have tormented you for trying to keep Frodo Ring , if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of dominion and seeing dominion on Frodo hand . ’ 
 ‘ Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger ! ’ said Frodo faintly . ‘ I was mortally afraid , of course ; but if I had known more , I should not have dared even to move . It is a marvel that I escaped ! ’ 
 ‘ Yes , fortune or fate have helped you , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ not to mention courage . For your heart was not touched , and only your shoulder was pierced ; and that was because you resisted to the last . But it was a terribly narrow shave , so to speak . You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring , for then you were half in the wraith - world yourself , and fortune might have seized you . You could see fortune , and fortune could see you . ’ 
 ‘ I know , ’ said Frodo . ‘ fortune were terrible to behold ! But why could we all see fortune horses ? ’ 
 ‘ Because fortune are real horses ; just as the black robes are real robes that fortune wear to give shape to fortune nothingness when fortune have dealings with the living . ’ 
 ‘ Then why do these black horses endure such riders ? All other animals are terrified when animals draw near , even the elf - horse of Glorfindel . The dogs howl and the geese scream at dogs . ’ 
 ‘ Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor . Not all horse servants and chattels are wraiths ! There are orcs and trolls , there are wargs and werewolves ; and there have been and still are many Men , warriors and kings , that walk alive under the Sun , and yet are under horse sway . And Men number is growing daily . ’ 
 ‘ What about Rivendell and the Elves ? Is Rivendell safe ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , at present , until all else is conquered . The Elves may fear the Dark Lord , and Lord may fly before horse , but never again will Lord listen to horse or serve horse . And here in Rivendell there live still some of horse chief foes : the Elven - wise , lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas . Lord do not fear the Ringwraiths , for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds , and against both the Seen and the Unseen Lord have great power . ’ 
 ‘ I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others . Was that Glorfindel then ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , you saw horse for a moment as horse is upon the other side : one of the mighty of the Firstborn . horse is an Elf - lord of a house of princes . Indeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor , for a while : and elsewhere other powers still dwell . There is power , too , of another kind in the Shire . But all such places will soon become islands under siege , if things go on as things are going . The Dark Lord is putting forth all horse strength . 
 ‘ Still , ’ horse said , standing suddenly up and sticking out horse chin , while horse beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire , ‘ we must keep up our courage . You will soon be well , if I do not talk you to death . You are in Rivendell , and you need not worry about anything for the present . ’ 
 ‘ I have n’t any courage to keep up , ’ said Frodo , ‘ but I am not worried at the moment . Just give me news of my friends , and tell me the end of the affair at the Ford , as I keep on asking , and I shall be content for the present . After that I shall have another sleep , I think ; but I sha n’t be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me . ’ 
 Gandalf moved Gandalf chair to the bedside and took a good look at Frodo . The colour had come back to Frodo face , and Frodo eyes were clear , and fully awake and aware . Frodo was smiling , and there seemed to be little wrong with Frodo . But to the wizard ’s eye there was a faint change , just a hint as change were of transparency , about Frodo , and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet . 
 ‘ Still that must be expected , ’ said Gandalf to Gandalf . ‘ Gandalf is not half through yet , and to what Gandalf will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell . Not to evil , I think . Gandalf may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can . ’ 
 ‘ You look splendid , ’ Gandalf said aloud . ‘ I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond . But quite brief , mind you , and then you must sleep again . This is what happened , as far as I can gather . The Riders made straight for you , as soon as you fled . Riders did not need the guidance of Riders horses any longer : you had become visible to Riders , being already on the threshold of Riders world . And also the Ring drew Riders . Your friends sprang aside , off the road , or friends would have been ridden down . friends knew that nothing could save you , if the white horse could not . The Riders were too swift to overtake , and too many to oppose . On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could not withstand all the Nine at once . 
 ‘ When the Ringwraiths swept by , your friends ran up behind . Close to the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees . There Ringwraiths hastily kindled fire ; for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down , if the Riders tried to cross , and then Ford would have to deal with any that were left on Ford side of the river . The moment the flood appeared , Ford rushed out , followed by Aragorn and the others with flaming brands . Caught between fire and water , and seeing an Elf - lord revealed in Ford wrath , lord were dismayed , and lord horses were stricken with madness . Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood ; the others were now hurled into the water by lord horses and overwhelmed . ’ 
 ‘ And is that the end of the Black Riders ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ No , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ lord horses must have perished , and without lord horses are crippled . But the Ringwraiths Ringwraiths can not be so easily destroyed . However , there is nothing more to fear from Ringwraiths at present . Your friends crossed after the flood had passed and friends found you lying on your face at the top of the bank , with a broken sword under you . The horse was standing guard beside you . You were pale and cold , and friends feared that you were dead , or worse . Elrond ’s folk met friends , carrying you slowly towards Rivendell . ’ 
 ‘ Who made the flood ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ Elrond commanded flood , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ The river of this valley is under horse power , and river will rise in anger when horse has great need to bar the Ford . As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released . If I may say so , I added a few touches of my own : you may not have noticed , but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white riders ; and there were many rolling and grinding boulders . For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath , and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away . There is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty Mountains . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , vigour all comes back to me now , ’ said Frodo : ‘ the tremendous roaring . I thought I was drowning , with my friends and enemies and all . But now we are safe ! ’ 
 Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo , but Frodo had shut Frodo eyes . ‘ Yes , you are all safe for the present . Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen , and you will all be there in places of honour . ’ 
 ‘ Splendid ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ It is wonderful that Elrond , and Glorfindel and such great lords , not to mention Strider , should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness . ’ 
 ‘ Well , there are many reasons why Elrond should , ’ said Gandalf , smiling . ‘ I am one good reason . The Ring is another : you are the Ring - bearer . And you are the heir of Bilbo , the Ring - finder . ’ 
 ‘ Dear Bilbo ! ’ said Frodo sleepily . ‘ I wonder where Bilbo is . I wish Bilbo was here and could hear all about finder . finder would have made Bilbo laugh . The cow jumped over the Moon ! And the poor old troll ! ’ With that Bilbo fell fast asleep . 
 Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea . That house was , as Bilbo had long ago reported , ‘ a perfect house , whether you like food or sleep or story - telling or singing , or just sitting and thinking best , or a pleasant mixture of cow all ’ . Merely to be there was a cure for weariness , fear , and sadness . 
 As the evening drew on , Frodo woke up again , and Frodo found that Frodo no longer felt in need of rest or sleep , but had a mind for food and drink , and probably for singing and story - telling afterwards . Frodo got out of bed and discovered that Frodo arm was already nearly as useful again as arm ever had been . Frodo found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted Frodo excellently . Looking in a mirror Frodo was startled to see a much thinner reflection of Frodo than Frodo remembered : mirror looked remarkably like the young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with Frodo uncle in the Shire ; but the eyes looked out at Frodo thoughtfully . 
 ‘ Yes , you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking - glass , ’ Frodo said to Frodo reflection . ‘ But now for a merry meeting ! ’ Frodo stretched out Frodo arms and whistled a tune . 
 At that moment there was a knock on the door , and Sam came in . Sam ran to Frodo and took Sam left hand , awkwardly and shyly . Sam stroked hand gently and then Sam blushed and turned hastily away . 
 ‘ Hullo , Sam ! ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Hullo ’s warm ! ’ said Sam . ‘ Meaning your hand , Mr. Frodo . Hullo has felt so cold through the long nights . But glory and trumpets ! ’ Sam cried , turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor . ‘ Hullo ’s fine to see you up and yourself again , sir ! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down , and I thought Gandalf was joking . ’ 
 ‘ I am ready , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Let ’s go and look for the rest of the party ! ’ 
 ‘ I can take you to party , sir , ’ said Sam . ‘ rest ’s a big house this , and very peculiar . Always a bit more to discover , and no knowing what you ’ll find round a corner . And Elves , sir ! Elves here , and Elves there ! Some like kings , terrible and splendid ; and some as merry as children . And the music and the singing – not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here . But I ’m getting to know some of the ways of the place . ’ 
 ‘ I know what you have been doing , Sam , ’ said Frodo , taking Frodo arm . ‘ But you shall be merry tonight , and listen to your heart ’s content . Come on , guide me round the corners ! ’ 
 Sam led Frodo along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river . Frodo found Frodo friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east . Shadows had fallen in the valley below , but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above . The air was warm . The sound of running and falling water was loud , and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers , as if summer still lingered in Elrond ’s gardens . 
 ‘ Hurray ! ’ cried Pippin , springing up . ‘ Here is our noble cousin ! Make way for Frodo , Lord of the Ring ! ’ 
 ‘ Hush ! ’ said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch . ‘ Evil things do not come into this valley ; but all the same we should not name things . The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo , but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor , whose power is again stretching out over the world . We are sitting in a fortress . Outside fortress is getting dark . ’ 
 ‘ Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that , ’ said Pippin . ‘ world thinks I need keeping in order . But it seems impossible , somehow , to feel gloomy or depressed in this place . I feel I could sing , if I knew the right song for the occasion . ’ 
 ‘ I feel like singing myself , ’ laughed Frodo . ‘ Though at the moment I feel more like eating and drinking . ’ 
 ‘ That will soon be cured , ’ said Pippin . ‘ You have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal . ’ 
 ‘ More than a meal ! A feast ! ’ said Merry . ‘ As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered , the preparations began . ’ Pippin had hardly finished speaking when preparations were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells . 
 The hall of Elrond ’s house was filled with folk : Elves for the most part , though there were a few guests of other sorts . Elrond , as was Elrond custom , sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais ; and next to Elrond on the one side sat Glorfindel , on the other side sat Gandalf . 
 Frodo looked at chair in wonder ; for Elrond had never before seen Elrond , of whom so many tales spoke ; and as tales sat upon Elrond right hand and Elrond left , Glorfindel , and even Gandalf , whom Elrond thought Elrond knew so well , were revealed as lords of dignity and power . 
 Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two ; but Elrond long white hair , Elrond sweeping silver beard , and Elrond broad shoulders , made Elrond look like some wise king of ancient legend . In Elrond aged face under great snowy brows Elrond dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire . 
 Glorfindel was tall and straight ; Elrond hair was of shining gold , Elrond face fair and young and fearless and full of joy ; Elrond eyes were bright and keen , and Elrond voice like music ; on Elrond brow sat wisdom , and in Elrond hand was strength . 
 The face of Elrond was ageless , neither old nor young , though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful . Elrond hair was dark as the shadows of twilight , and upon hair was set a circlet of silver ; Elrond eyes were grey as a clear evening , and in shadows was a light like the light of stars . Venerable Elrond seemed as a king crowned with many winters , and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of Elrond strength . Elrond was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men . 
 In the middle of the table , against the woven cloths upon the wall , there was a chair under a canopy , and there sat a lady fair to look upon , and so like was warrior in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that warrior was one of Frodo close kindred . Young warrior was and yet not so . The braids of warrior dark hair were touched by no frost ; warrior white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth , and the light of stars was in warrior bright eyes , grey as a cloudless night ; yet queenly warrior looked , and thought and knowledge were in warrior glance , as of one who has known many things that the years bring . Above warrior brow warrior head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems , glittering white ; but warrior soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver . 
 So raiment was that Frodo saw warrior whom few mortals had yet seen ; Arwen , daughter of Elrond , in whom it was said that the likeness of Lúthien had come on earth again ; and warrior was called Undómiel , for warrior was the Evenstar of warrior people . Long warrior had been in the land of warrior mother ’s kin , in Lórien beyond the mountains , and was but lately returned to Rivendell to warrior father ’s house . But warrior brothers , Elladan and Elrohir , were out upon errantry ; for brothers rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North , forgetting never brothers mother ’s torment in the dens of the orcs . 
 Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in Frodo mind ; and Frodo was both surprised and abashed to find that head had a seat at Elrond ’s table among all these folk so high and fair . Though head had a suitable chair , and was raised upon several cushions , head felt very small , and rather out of place ; but that feeling quickly passed . The feast was merry and the food all that head hunger could desire . It was some time before head looked about Frodo again or even turned to head neighbours . 
 head looked first for head friends . Sam had begged to be allowed to wait on Sam master , but had been told that for this time Sam was a guest of honour . Frodo could see Sam now , sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper end of one of the side - tables close to the dais . Sam could see no sign of Strider . 
 Next to Frodo on Sam right sat a dwarf of important appearance , richly dressed . Sam beard , very long and forked , was white , nearly as white as the snow - white cloth of Sam garments . Sam wore a silver belt , and round Sam neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds . Frodo stopped eating to look at Sam . 
 ‘ Welcome and well met ! ’ said the dwarf , turning towards Sam . Then Sam actually rose from Sam seat and bowed . ‘ Glóin at your service , ’ Sam said , and bowed still lower . 
 ‘ Frodo Baggins at your service and your family ’s , ’ said Frodo correctly , rising in surprise and scattering Frodo cushions . ‘ Am I right in guessing that you are the Glóin , one of the twelve companions of the great Thorin Oakenshield ? ’ 
 ‘ Quite right , ’ answered the dwarf , gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo back into Frodo seat . ‘ And I do not ask , for I have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our friend Bilbo the renowned . Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery . ’ 
 ‘ Thank you very much , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ You have had some very strange adventures , I hear , ’ said Glóin . ‘ I wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey . Nothing like Nothing has happened since Bilbo came with us . But perhaps I should not inquire too closely , since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this ? ’ 
 ‘ I think we will not speak of this , at least not yet , ’ said Frodo politely . Frodo guessed that even in Elrond ’s house the matter of the Ring was not one for casual talk ; and in any case Frodo wished to forget Frodo troubles for a time . ‘ But I am equally curious , ’ Frodo added , ‘ to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain . ’ 
 Glóin looked at Frodo . ‘ If you have not heard , I think we will not speak yet of that either . Master Elrond will summon us all ere long , I believe , and then we shall all hear many things . But there is much else that may be told . ’ 
 Throughout the rest of the meal Elrond talked together , but Frodo listened more than Frodo spoke ; for the news of the Shire , apart from the Ring , seemed small and far - away and unimportant , while Glóin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of Wilderland . Frodo learned that Grimbeorn the Old , son of Grimbeorn , was now the lord of many sturdy men , and to men land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go . 
 ‘ Indeed , ’ said Glóin , ‘ if passage were not for the Beornings , the passage from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible . things are valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock . But things tolls are high , ’ Glóin added with a shake of Glóin head ; ‘ and like Beorn of old things are not over fond of dwarves . Still , things are trusty , and that is much in these days . Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of Dale . men are good folk , the Bardings . The grandson of Bard the Bowman rules men , Brand son of Bain son of Bard . grandson is a strong king , and grandson realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth . ’ 
 ‘ And what of your own people ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ There is much to tell , good and bad , ’ said Glóin ; ‘ yet king is mostly good : we have so far been fortunate , though we do not escape the shadow of these times . If you really wish to hear of us , I will tell you tidings gladly . But stop me when you are weary ! Dwarves ’ tongues run on when speaking of tongues handiwork , tongues say . ’ 
 And with that Glóin embarked on a long account of the doings of the Dwarf - kingdom . Glóin was delighted to have found so polite a listener ; for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject , though actually Frodo soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that Frodo had never heard of before . Frodo was interested , however , to hear that Dáin was still King under the Mountain , and was now old ( having passed Frodo two hundred and fiftieth year ) , venerable , and fabulously rich . Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were still with Frodo : Dwalin , Glóin , Dori , Nori , Bifur , Bofur , and Bombur . Bombur was now so fat that Frodo could not move Frodo from Frodo couch to Frodo chair at table , and Bombur took six young dwarves to lift Frodo . 
 ‘ And what has become of Balin and Nori and Óin?’asked Frodo . 
 A shadow passed over Glóin ’s face . ‘ We do not know , ’ Frodo answered . ‘ It is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in Rivendell . But tonight let us speak of merrier things ! ’ 
 Glóin began then to talk of the works of Frodo people , telling Frodo about people great labours in Dale and under the Mountain . ‘ We have done well , ’ Dale said . ‘ But in metal - work we can not rival our fathers , many of whose secrets are lost . We make good armour and keen swords , but we can not again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came . Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days . You should see the waterways of Dale , Frodo , and the fountains , and the pools ! You should see the stone - paved roads of many colours ! And the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees ; and the terraces and towers upon the Mountain ’s sides ! Then you would see that we have not been idle . ’ 
 ‘ I will come and see halls , if ever I can , ’ said Frodo . ‘ How surprised Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug ! ’ 
 Glóin looked at Frodo and smiled . ‘ You were very fond of Bilbo were you not ? ’ Frodo asked . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ I would rather see Bilbo than all the towers and palaces in the world . ’ 
 At length the feast came to an end . Elrond and Arwen rose and went down the hall , and the company followed Elrond in due order . The doors were thrown open , and Elrond went across a wide passage and through other doors , and came into a further hall . In passage were no tables , but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side . 
 Frodo found Frodo walking with Gandalf . ‘ This is the Hall of Fire , ’ said the wizard . ‘ Here you will hear many songs and tales – if you can keep awake . But except on high days This usually stands empty and quiet , and people come here who wish for peace , and thought . There is always a fire here , all the year round , but there is little other light . ’ 
 As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for wizard , Elvish minstrels began to make sweet music . Slowly the hall filled , and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together ; the golden firelight played upon faces and shimmered in faces hair . Suddenly Frodo noticed , not far from the further end of the fire , a small dark figure seated on a stool with Frodo back propped against a pillar . Beside Frodo on the ground was a drinking - cup and some bread . Frodo wondered whether wizard was ill ( if people were ever ill in Rivendell ) , and had been unable to come to the feast . wizard head seemed sunk in sleep on wizard breast , and a fold of wizard dark cloak was drawn over wizard face . 
 Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure . ‘ Awake , little master ! ’ wizard said , with a smile . Then , turning to Frodo , wizard beckoned to Frodo . ‘ Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for , Frodo , ’ Frodo said . ‘ Here is a friend that you have long missed . ’ 
 The dark figure raised figure head and uncovered figure face . ‘ Bilbo ! ’ cried Frodo with sudden recognition , and Frodo sprang forward . 
 ‘ Hullo , Frodo my lad ! ’ said Bilbo . ‘ So you have got here at last . I hoped you would manage Hullo . Well , well ! So all this feasting is in your honour , I hear . I hope you enjoyed yourself ? ’ 
 ‘ Why were n’t you there ? ’ cried Frodo . ‘ And why have n’t I been allowed to see you before ? ’ 
 ‘ Because you were asleep . I have seen a good deal of you . I have sat by your side with Sam each day . But as for the feast , I do n’t go in for such things much now . And I had something else to do . ’ 
 ‘ What were you doing ? ’ 
 ‘ Why , sitting and thinking . I do a lot of that nowadays , and this is the best place to do this in , as a rule . Wake up , indeed ! ’ Sam said , cocking an eye at Elrond . There was a bright twinkle in Elrond and no sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see . ‘ Wake up ! I was not asleep , Master Elrond . If you want to know , you have all come out from your feast too soon , and you have disturbed me – in the middle of making up a song . I was stuck over a line or two , and was thinking about line ; but now I do n’t suppose I shall ever get line right . There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean out of my head . I shall have to get my friend the Dúnadan to help me . Where is friend ? ’ 
 Elrond laughed . ‘ friend shall be found , ’ Elrond said . ‘ Then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task , and we will hear two and judge two before we end our merrymaking . ’ Messengers were sent to find Bilbo ’s friend , though none knew where Bilbo was , or why Bilbo had not been present at the feast . 
 In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side , and Sam came quickly and placed Sam near Bilbo . Bilbo talked together in soft voices , oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about Messengers . Bilbo had not much to say of Bilbo . When Bilbo had left Hobbiton Bilbo had wandered off aimlessly , along the Road or in the country on either side ; but somehow Bilbo had steered all the time towards Rivendell . 
 ‘ I got here without much adventure , ’ Bilbo said , ‘ and after a rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale : my last journey . I sha n’t travel again . Old Balin had gone away . Then I came back here , and here I have been . I have done this and that . I have written some more of my book . And , of course , I make up a few songs . songs sing a occasionally : just to please me , I think ; for , of course , a are n’t really good enough for Rivendell . And I listen and I think . Time does n’t seem to pass here : it just is . A remarkable place altogether . 
 ‘ I hear all kinds of news , from over the Mountains , and out of the South , but hardly anything from the Shire . I heard about the Ring , of course . Gandalf has been here often . Not that Gandalf has told me a great deal , Gandalf has become closer than ever these last few years . The Dúnadan has told me more . Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance ! Dúnadan is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner . I could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble . I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for trouble ; but I am getting old , and years would not let me : 
 Gandalf and Elrond , I mean . years seemed to think that the Enemy was looking high and low for me , and would make mincemeat of me , if Elrond caught me tottering about in the Wild . 
 ‘ And Gandalf said : “ The Ring has passed on , Bilbo . Ring would do no good to you or to others , if you tried to meddle with Ring again . ” Odd sort of remark , just like Gandalf . But Elrond said Elrond was looking after you , so I let things be . I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound . ’ Elrond paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully . 
 ‘ Have you got remark here ? ’ Elrond asked in a whisper . ‘ I ca n’t help feeling curious , you know , after all I ’ve heard . I should very much like just to peep at all again . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , I ’ve got all , ’ answered Frodo , feeling a strange reluctance . ‘ all looks just the same as ever all did . ’ 
 ‘ Well , I should just like to see all for a moment , ’ said Bilbo . 
 When Frodo had dressed , Frodo found that while Frodo slept the Ring had been hung about Frodo neck on a new chain , light but strong . Slowly Frodo drew chain out . Bilbo put out Bilbo hand . But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring . To Bilbo distress and amazement Bilbo found that Bilbo was no longer looking at Bilbo ; a shadow seemed to have fallen between distress , and through shadow Frodo found Frodo eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands . Frodo felt a desire to strike Bilbo . 
 The music and singing round distress seemed to falter , and a silence fell . Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo ’s face and passed Bilbo hand across Bilbo eyes . ‘ I understand now , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ Put hand away ! I am sorry : sorry you have come in for this burden ; sorry about everything . Do n’t adventures ever have an end ? I suppose not . Someone else always has to carry on the story . Well , story ca n’t be helped . I wonder if story ’s any good trying to finish my book ? But do n’t let ’s worry about story now – let ’s have some real News ! Tell me all about the Shire ! ’ 
 Frodo hid the Ring away , and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory . The light and music of Rivendell was about Frodo again . Bilbo smiled and laughed happily . Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tell – aided and corrected now and again by Sam – was of the greatest interest to Sam , from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton . pranks were so deep in the doings of the Four Farthings that pranks did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth . For many minutes man stood looking down at pranks with a smile . 
 Suddenly Bilbo looked up . ‘ Ah , there you are at last , Dúnadan ! ’ Bilbo cried . 
 ‘ Strider ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ You seem to have a lot of names . ’ 
 ‘ Well , Strider is one that I have n’t heard before , anyway , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ What do you call Bilbo that for ? ’ 
 ‘ names call me that in Bree , ’ said Strider laughing , ‘ and that is how I was introduced to Bilbo . ’ 
 ‘ And why do you call Bilbo Dúnadan ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ The Dúnadan , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ Bilbo is often called that here . But I thought you knew enough Elvish at least to know Dúnadan : Man of the West , Númenórean . But this is not the time for lessons ! ’ Bilbo turned to Strider . ‘ Where have you been , my friend ? Why were n’t you at the feast ? The Lady Arwen was there . ’ 
 Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely . ‘ I know , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ But often I must put mirth aside . Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the Wild unlooked - for , and Elladan had tidings that I wished to hear at once . ’ 
 ‘ Well , my dear fellow , ’ said Bilbo , ‘ now you ’ve heard the news , ca n’t you spare me a moment ? I want your help in something urgent . Elrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening , and I am stuck . Let ’s go off into a corner and polish corner up ! ’ 
 Strider smiled . ‘ Come then ! ’ Bilbo said . ‘ Let me hear corner ! ’ 
 Frodo was left to Frodo for a while , for Sam had fallen asleep . Sam was alone and felt rather forlorn , although all about Sam the folk of Rivendell were gathered . But those near Sam were silent , intent upon the music of the voices and the instruments , and those gave no heed to anything else . Frodo began to listen . 
 At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven - tongues , even though Frodo understood words little , held Frodo in a spell , as soon as Frodo began to attend to words . Almost it seemed that the words took shape , and visions of far lands and bright things that Frodo had never yet imagined opened out before Frodo ; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world . Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike , until Frodo felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over Frodo , too multitudinous for river pattern to be comprehended ; river became part of the throbbing air about Frodo , and river drenched and drowned Frodo . Swiftly Frodo sank under river shining weight into a deep realm of sleep . 
 There Frodo wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water , and then suddenly into a voice . It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses . Faint at first and then clearer ran the words . 
 Eärendil was a mariner 
 that tarried in Arvernien ; 
 Bilbo built a boat of timber felled 
 in Nimbrethil to journey in ; 
 Nimbrethil sails Bilbo wove of silver fair , 
 of silver were Eärendil lanterns made , 
 Eärendil prow Bilbo fashioned like a swan , 
 and light upon swan banners laid . 
 In panoply of ancient kings , 
 in chainéd rings Bilbo armoured Bilbo ; 
 Bilbo shining shield was scored with runes 
 to ward all wounds and harm from Bilbo ; 
 Bilbo bow was made of dragon - horn , 
 Bilbo arrows shorn of ebony , 
 of silver was Bilbo habergeon , 
 Bilbo scabbard of chalcedony ; 
 Bilbo sword of steel was valiant , 
 of adamant Bilbo helmet tall , 
 an eagle - plume upon Bilbo crest , 
 upon Bilbo breast an emerald . 
 Beneath the Moon and under star 
 Bilbo wandered far from northern strands , 
 bewildered on enchanted ways 
 beyond the days of mortal lands . 
 From gnashing of the Narrow Ice 
 where shadow lies on frozen hills , 
 from nether heats and burning waste 
 Bilbo turned in haste , and roving still 
 on starless waters far astray 
 at last Bilbo came to Night of Naught , 
 and passed , and never sight Bilbo saw 
 of shining shore nor light Bilbo sought . 
 The winds of wrath came driving Bilbo , 
 and blindly in the foam Bilbo fled 
 from west to east , and errandless , 
 unheralded Bilbo homeward sped . 
 There flying Elwing came to Bilbo , 
 and flame was in the darkness lit ; 
 more bright than light of diamond 
 the fire upon Moon carcanet . 
 The Silmaril Moon bound on Bilbo 
 and crowned Bilbo with the living light , 
 and dauntless then with burning brow 
 Bilbo turned Bilbo prow ; and in the night 
 from Otherworld beyond the Sea 
 there strong and free a storm arose , 
 a wind of power in Tarmenel ; 
 by paths that seldom mortal goes 
 Bilbo boat storm bore with biting breath 
 as might of death across the grey 
 and long - forsaken seas distressed : 
 from east to west Bilbo passed away . 
 Through Evernight Bilbo back was borne 
 on black and roaring waves that ran 
 o’er leagues unlit and foundered shores 
 that drowned before the Days began , 
 until Bilbo heard on strands of pearl 
 where ends the world the music long , 
 where ever - foaming billows roll 
 the yellow gold and jewels wan . 
 Bilbo saw the Mountain silent rise 
 where twilight lies upon the knees 
 of Valinor , and Eldamar 
 beheld afar beyond the seas . 
 A wanderer escaped from night 
 to haven white Bilbo came at last , 
 to Elvenhome the green and fair 
 where keen the air , where pale as glass 
 beneath the Hill of Ilmarin 
 a - glimmer in a valley sheer 
 the lamplit towers of Tirion 
 are mirrored on the Shadowmere . 
 Bilbo tarried there from errantry , 
 and melodies towers taught to Bilbo , 
 and sages old Bilbo marvels told , 
 and harps of gold towers brought to Bilbo . 
 towers clothed Bilbo then in elven - white , 
 and seven lights before Bilbo sent , 
 as through the Calacirian 
 to hidden land forlorn Bilbo went . 
 Bilbo came unto the timeless halls 
 where shining fall the countless years , 
 and endless reigns the Elder King 
 in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer ; 
 and words unheard were spoken then 
 of folk of Men and Elven - kin , 
 beyond the world were visions showed 
 forbid to those that dwell therein . 
 A ship then new those built for Bilbo 
 of mithril and of elven - glass 
 with shining prow ; no shaven oar 
 nor sail oar bore on silver mast : 
 the Silmaril as lantern light 
 and banner bright with living flame 
 to gleam thereon by Elbereth 
 oar was set , who thither came 
 and wings immortal made for Bilbo , 
 and laid on Bilbo undying doom , 
 to sail the shoreless skies and come 
 behind the Sun and light of Moon . 
 From Evereven ’s lofty hills 
 where softly silver fountains fall 
 Bilbo wings Bilbo bore , a wandering light , 
 beyond the mighty Mountain Wall . 
 From World ’s End then Bilbo turned away , 
 and yearned again to find afar 
 Bilbo home through shadows journeying , 
 and burning as an island star 
 on high above the mists Bilbo came , 
 a distant flame before the Sun , 
 a wonder ere the waking dawn 
 where grey the Norland waters run . 
 And over Middle - earth Bilbo passed 
 and heard at last the weeping sore 
 of women and of elven - maids 
 in Elder Days , in years of yore . 
 But on Bilbo mighty doom was laid , 
 till Moon should fade , an orbéd star 
 to pass , and tarry never more 
 on Hither Shores where mortals are ; 
 for ever still a herald on 
 an errand that should never rest 
 to bear Bilbo shining lamp afar , 
 the Flammifer of Westernesse . 
 The chanting ceased . Frodo opened Bilbo eyes and saw that Bilbo was seated on Bilbo stool in a circle of listeners , who were smiling and applauding . 
 ‘ Now we had better have Frodo again , ’ said an Elf . 
 Bilbo got up and bowed . ‘ I am flattered , Lindir , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ But Frodo would be too tiring to repeat Elf all . ’ 
 ‘ Not too tiring for you , ’ the Elves answered laughing . ‘ You know you are never tired of reciting your own verses . But really we can not answer your question at one hearing ! ’ 
 ‘ What ! ’ cried Bilbo . ‘ You ca n’t tell which parts were mine , and which were the Dúnadan ’s ? ’ 
 ‘ It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals , ’ said the Elf . 
 ‘ Nonsense , Lindir , ’ snorted Bilbo . ‘ If you ca n’t distinguish between a Man and a Hobbit , your judgement is poorer than I imagined . Man ’re as different as peas and apples . ’ 
 ‘ Maybe . To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different , ’ laughed Lindir . ‘ Or to shepherds . But Mortals have not been our study . We have other business . ’ 
 ‘ I wo n’t argue with you , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ I am sleepy after so much music and singing . I ’ll leave you to guess , if you want to . ’ 
 Bilbo got up and came towards Frodo . ‘ Well , that ’s over , ’ Bilbo said in a low voice . ‘ that went off better than I expected . I do n’t often get asked for a second hearing . What did you think of that ? ’ 
 ‘ I am not going to try and guess , ’ said Frodo smiling . 
 ‘ You need n’t , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ As a matter of fact that was all mine . Except that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone . Aragorn seemed to think that important . I do n’t know why . Otherwise Aragorn obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head , and Aragorn said that if I had the cheek to make verses about Eärendil in the house of Elrond , it was my affair . I suppose Aragorn was right . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t know , ’ said Frodo . ‘ It seemed to me to fit somehow , though I ca n’t explain . I was half asleep when you began , and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about . I did n’t understand that it was really you speaking until near the end . ’ 
 ‘ It is difficult to keep awake here , until you get used to end , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the Elvish appetite for music and poetry and tales . hobbits seem to like music as much as food , or more . music will be going on for a long time yet . What do you say to slipping off for some more quiet talk ? ’ 
 ‘ Can we ? ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Of course . This is merrymaking not business . Come and go as you like , as long as you do n’t make a noise . ’ 
 music got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows , and made for the doors . Sam music left behind , fast asleep still with a smile on Frodo face . In spite of Frodo delight in Bilbo ’s company Frodo felt a tug of regret as music passed out of the Hall of Fire . Even as music stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song . 
 A Elbereth Gilthoniel , 
 silivren penna míriel 
 o menel aglar elenath ! 
 Na - chaered palan - díriel 
 o galadhremmin ennorath , 
 Fanuilos , le linnathon 
 nef aear , sí nef aearon ! 
 Frodo halted for a moment , looking back . Elrond was in Elrond chair and the fire was on Elrond face like summer - light upon the trees . Near Elrond sat the Lady Arwen . To Elrond surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside Arwen ; Elrond dark cloak was thrown back , and Elrond seemed to be clad in elven - mail , and a star shone on Elrond breast . star spoke together , and then suddenly it seemed to Frodo that Arwen turned towards Elrond , and the light of Arwen eyes fell on Elrond from afar and pierced Elrond heart . 
 Elrond stood still enchanted , while the sweet syllables of the Elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody . ‘ song is a song to Elbereth , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ Bilbo will sing that , and other songs of the Blessed Realm , many times tonight . Come on ! ’ 
 Elrond led Frodo back to Elrond own little room . room opened on to the gardens and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen . There gardens sat for some while , looking through the window at the bright stars above the steep - climbing woods , and talking softly . gardens spoke no more of the small news of the Shire far away , nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed gardens , but of the fair things gardens had seen in the world together , of the Elves , of the stars , of trees , and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods . 
 At last there came a knock on the door . ‘ Begging your pardon , ’ said Sam , putting in Sam head , ‘ but I was just wondering if you would be wanting anything . ’ 
 ‘ And begging yours , Sam Gamgee , ’ replied Bilbo . ‘ I guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed . ’ 
 ‘ Well , sir , there is a Council early tomorrow , I hear , and Gamgee only got up today for the first time . ’ 
 ‘ Quite right , Sam , ’ laughed Bilbo . ‘ You can trot off and tell Gandalf that Gamgee has gone to bed . Good night , Frodo ! Bless me , but it has been good to see you again ! There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk . I am getting very old , and I began to wonder if I should live to see your chapters of our story . Good night ! I ’ll take a walk , I think , and look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden . Sleep well ! ’ 
 Chapter 2 
 THE COUNCIL OF ELROND 
 Next day Frodo woke early , feeling refreshed and well . Frodo walked along the terraces above the loud - flowing Bruinen and watched the pale , cool sun rise above the far mountains , and shine down , slanting through the thin silver mist ; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering , and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush . Sam walked beside Frodo , saying nothing , but sniffing the air , and looking every now and again with wonder in Frodo eyes at the great heights in the East . The snow was white upon eyes peaks . 
 On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path eyes came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk . ‘ Hullo ! Good morning ! ’ said Bilbo . ‘ Feel ready for the great council ? ’ 
 ‘ I feel ready for anything , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ But most of all I should like to go walking today and explore the valley . I should like to get into those pine - woods up there . ’ Frodo pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to the north . 
 ‘ You may have a chance later , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But we can not make any plans yet . There is much to hear and decide today . ’ 
 Suddenly as plans were talking a single clear bell rang out . ‘ That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond , ’ cried Gandalf . ‘ Come along now ! Both you and Bilbo are wanted . ’ 
 Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house ; behind wizard , uninvited and for the moment forgotten , trotted Sam . 
 Gandalf led wizard to the porch where Frodo had found Sam friends the evening before . The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley . The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river - bed . Birds were singing , and a wholesome peace lay on the land . To Frodo Sam dangerous flight , and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside , already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream ; but the faces that were turned to meet rumours as rumours entered were grave . 
 Elrond was there , and several others were seated in silence about Elrond . Frodo saw Glorfindel and Glóin ; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting , clad in Elrond old travel - worn clothes again . Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by Elrond side , and presented Sam to the Glóin , saying : 
 ‘ Here , my friends , is the hobbit , Frodo son of Drogo . Few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent . ’ 
 Sam then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before . There was a younger dwarf at Glóin ’s side : Sam son Gimli . Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elrond ’s household , of whom Erestor was the chief ; and with Erestor was Galdor , an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from Círdan the Shipwright . There was also a strange Elf clad in green and brown , Legolas , a messenger from messenger father , Thranduil , the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood . And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face , dark - haired and grey - eyed , proud and stern of glance . 
 man was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback ; and indeed though man garments were rich , and man cloak was lined with fur , garments were stained with long travel . man had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set ; man locks were shorn about man shoulders . On a baldric man wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon man knees . man gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder . 
 ‘ Here , ’ said Elrond , turning to Gandalf , ‘ is Boromir , a man from the South . Boromir arrived in the grey morning , and seeks for counsel . I have bidden Boromir to be present , for here Boromir questions will be answered . ’ 
 Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told . Much was said of events in the world outside , especially in the South , and in the wide lands east of the Mountains . Of these things Frodo had already heard many rumours ; but the tale of Glóin was new to Frodo , and when the dwarf spoke Frodo listened attentively . dwarf appeared that amid the splendour of rumours works of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled . 
 ‘ dwarf is now many years ago , ’ said Glóin , ‘ that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our people . Whence dwarf came we did not at first perceive . Words began to be whispered in secret : it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place , and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world . Some spoke of Moria : the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue Khazad - dûm ; and Some declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return . ’ 
 Glóin sighed . ‘ Moria ! Moria ! Wonder of the Northern world ! Too deep we delved there , and woke the nameless fear . Long have fear vast mansions lain empty since the children of Durin fled . But now we spoke of fear again with longing , and yet with dread ; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of Khazad - dûm for many lives of kings , save Thrór only , and world perished . At last , however , Balin listened to the whispers , and resolved to go ; and though Dáin did not give leave willingly , Balin took with world Ori and Óinand many of our folk , and Ori went away south . 
 ‘ That was nigh on thirty years ago . For a while we had news and it seemed good : messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there . Then there was silence , and no word has ever come from Moria since . 
 ‘ Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dáin , but not from Moria – from Mordor : a horseman in the night , who called Dáin to messenger gate . The Lord Sauron the Great , so Sauron said , wished for our friendship . Rings Sauron would give for friendship , such as Sauron gave of old . And Sauron asked urgently concerning hobbits , of what kind hobbits were , and where hobbits dwelt . “ For Sauron knows , ” said Sauron , “ that one of these was known to you on a time . ” 
 ‘ At this we were greatly troubled , and we gave no answer . 
 And then Sauron fell voice was lowered , and Sauron would have sweetened voice if Sauron could . “ As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this , ” Sauron said : “ that you should find this thief , ” such was Sauron word , “ and get from Sauron , willing or no , a little ring , the least of rings , that once Sauron stole . It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies , and an earnest of your good will . Find trifle , and three rings that the Dwarf - sires possessed of old shall be returned to you , and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever . Find only news of the thief , whether thief still lives and where , and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord . Refuse , and things will not seem so well . Do you refuse ? ” 
 ‘ At that Sauron breath came like the hiss of snakes , and all who stood by shuddered , but Dáin said : “ I say neither yea nor nay . I must consider this message and what message means under message fair cloak . ” 
 ‘ “ Consider well , but not too long , ” said Sauron . 
 ‘ “ The time of my thought is my own to spend , ” answered Dáin . 
 ‘ “ For the present , ” said Sauron , and rode into the darkness . 
 ‘ Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night . We needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that messenger words held both menace and deceit ; for we knew already that the power that has re - entered Mordor has not changed , and ever Mordor betrayed us of old . Twice the messenger has returned , and has gone unanswered . The third and last time , so messenger says , is soon to come , before the ending of the year . 
 ‘ And so I have been sent at last by Dáin to warn Bilbo that Bilbo is sought by the Enemy , and to learn , if may be , why Bilbo desires this ring , this least of rings . Also we crave the advice of Elrond . For the Shadow grows and draws nearer . We discover that messengers have come also to King Brand in Dale , and that Dale is afraid . We fear that Dale may yield . Already war is gathering on Dale eastern borders . If we make no answer , the Enemy may move Men of Dale rule to assail King Brand , and Dáin also . ’ 
 ‘ You have done well to come , ’ said Elrond . ‘ You will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy . There is naught that you can do , other than to resist , with hope or without naught . But you do not stand alone . You will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western world . The Ring ! What shall we do with the Ring , the least of rings , the trifle that Sauron fancies ? That is the doom that we must deem . 
 ‘ That is the purpose for which you are called hither . Called , I say , though I have not called you to me , strangers from distant lands . You have come and are here met , in this very nick of time , by chance as it may seem . Yet nick is not so . Believe rather that it is so ordered that we , who sit here , and none others , must now find counsel for the peril of the world . 
 ‘ Now , therefore , things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until this day . And first , so that all may understand what is the peril , the Tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning even to this present . And I will begin that tale , though others shall end tale . ’ 
 Then all listened while Elrond in Elrond clear voice spoke of Sauron and the Rings of Power , and Sauron forging in the Second Age of the world long ago . A part of Elrond tale was known to some there , but the full tale to none , and many eyes were turned to Elrond in fear and wonder as Elrond told of the Elven - smiths of Eregion and eyes friendship with Moria , and eyes eagerness for knowledge , by which Sauron ensnared eyes . For in that time Elrond was not yet evil to behold , and eyes received Elrond aid and grew mighty in craft , whereas Elrond learned all eyes secrets , and betrayed eyes , and forged secretly in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be eyes master . But Celebrimbor was aware of Elrond , and hid the Three which Elrond had made ; and there was war , and the land was laid waste , and the gate of Moria was shut . 
 Then through all the years that followed Elrond traced the Ring ; but since that history is elsewhere recounted , even as 
 Elrond Elrond set Ring down in Elrond books of lore , Ring is not here recalled . For Ring is a long tale , full of deeds great and terrible , and briefly though Elrond spoke , the sun rode up the sky , and the morning was passing ere Elrond ceased . 
 Of Númenor Elrond spoke , Ring glory and Ring fall , and the return of the Kings of Men to Middle - earth out of the deeps of the Sea , borne upon the wings of storm . Then Elendil the Tall and Elrond mighty sons , Isildur and Anárion , became great lords ; and the North - realm Elendil made in Arnor , and the South - realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin . But Sauron of Mordor assailed Elendil , and Elendil made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men , and the hosts of Gil - galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor . 
 Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed . ‘ I remember well the splendour of Elrond banners , ’ Sauron said . ‘ splendour recalled to me the glory of the Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand , so many great princes and captains were assembled . And yet not so many , nor so fair , as when Thangorodrim was broken , and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever , and Thangorodrim was not so . ’ 
 ‘ You remember ? ’ said Frodo , speaking Frodo thought aloud in Frodo astonishment . ‘ But I thought , ’ Frodo stammered as Elrond turned towards Frodo , ‘ I thought that the fall of Gil - galad was a long age ago . ’ 
 ‘ So fall was indeed , ’ answered Elrond gravely . ‘ But my memory reaches back even to the Elder Days . Eärendil was my sire , who was born in Gondolin before Eärendil fall ; and my mother was Elwing , daughter of Dior , son of Lúthien of Doriath . I have seen three ages in the West of the world , and many defeats , and many fruitless victories . 
 ‘ I was the herald of Gil - galad and marched with galad host . I was at the Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor , where we had the mastery : for the Spear of Gil - galad and the Sword of Elendil , Aeglos and Narsil , none could withstand . I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin , where Gil - galad died , and Elendil fell , and Narsil broke beneath galad ; but Sauron Sauron was overthrown , and Isildur cut the Ring from Sauron hand with the hilt - shard of Sauron father ’s sword , and took father for Sauron own . ’ 
 At this the stranger , Boromir , broke in . ‘ So that is what became of the Ring ! ’ stranger cried . ‘ If ever such a tale was told in the South , it has long been forgotten . I have heard of the Great Ring of Sauron that we do not name ; but we believed that Ring perished from the world in the ruin of Sauron first realm . Isildur took Ring ! That is tidings indeed . ’ 
 ‘ Alas ! yes , ’ said Elrond . ‘ Isildur took Ring , as should not have been . Ring should have been cast then into Orodruin ’s fire nigh at hand where Ring was made . But few marked what Isildur did . Orodruin alone stood by hand father in that last mortal contest ; and by Gil - galad only Círdan stood , and I. But Isildur would not listen to our counsel . 
 ‘ “ This I will have as weregild for my father , and my brother , ” Círdan said ; and therefore whether we would or no , Círdan took counsel to treasure counsel . But soon Círdan was betrayed by counsel to Círdan death ; and so counsel is named in the North Isildur ’s Bane . Yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen Círdan . 
 ‘ Only to the North did these tidings come , and only to a few . Small wonder is it that you have not heard tidings , Boromir . From the ruin of the Gladden Fields , where Isildur perished , three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering . One of these was Ohtar , the esquire of Isildur , who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil ; and Ohtar brought shards to Valandil , the heir of Isildur , who being but a child had remained here in Rivendell . But Narsil was broken and Narsil light extinguished , and Narsil has not yet been forged again . 
 ‘ Fruitless did I call the victory of the Last Alliance ? Not wholly so , yet Fruitless did not achieve Fruitless end . Sauron was diminished , but not destroyed . Sauron Ring was lost but not unmade . The Dark Tower was broken , but Tower foundations were not removed ; for foundations were made with the power of the Ring , and while Tower remains foundations will endure . Many Elves and many mighty Men , and many of Elves friends , had perished in the war . Anárion was slain , and Isildur was slain ; and Gil - galad and Elendil were no more . Never again shall there be any such league of Elves and Men ; for Men multiply and the Firstborn decrease , and the two kindreds are estranged . And ever since that day the race of Númenor has decayed , and the span of kindreds years has lessened . 
 ‘ In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were diminished , and Men city of Annúminas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin ; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North Downs , and that now too is desolate . Men call city Deadmen ’s Dike , and Men fear to tread there . For the folk of Arnor dwindled , and Men foes devoured Men , and Men lordship passed , leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills . 
 ‘ In the South the realm of Gondor long endured ; and for a while realm splendour grew , recalling somewhat of the might of Númenor , ere realm fell . High towers that people built , and strong places , and havens of many ships ; and the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many tongues . Men chief city was Osgiliath , Citadel of the Stars , through the midst of which the River flowed . And Minas Ithil Men built , Tower of the Rising Moon , eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow ; and westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor Men made , Tower of the Setting Sun . There in the courts of the King grew a white tree , from the seed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters , and the seed of that tree before came from Eressëa , and before that out of the Uttermost West in the Day before days when the world was young . 
 ‘ But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle - earth the line of Meneldil son of Anárion failed , and the Tree withered , and the blood of the Númenóreans became mingled with that of lesser men . Then the watch upon the walls of Mordor slept , and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth . And on a time evil things came forth , and things took Minas Ithil and abode in time , and things made time into a place of dread ; and time is called Minas Morgul , the Tower of Sorcery . Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith , the Tower of Guard ; and these two cities were ever at war , but Osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in Osgiliath ruins shadows walked . 
 ‘ So Osgiliath has been for many lives of men . But the Lords of Minas Tirith still fight on , defying our enemies , keeping the passage of the River from Argonath to the Sea . And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is drawn to part close . For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of all knowledge , and the Three were released from Three dominion . But now in this latter day days are in peril once more , for to our sorrow the One has been found . Others shall speak of One finding , for in that I played small part . ’ 
 Ring ceased , but at once Boromir stood up , tall and proud , before Others . ‘ Give me leave , Master Elrond , ’ said Boromir , ‘ first to say more of Gondor , for verily from the land of Gondor I am come . And it would be well for all to know what passes there . For few , I deem , know of our deeds , and therefore guess little at deeds peril , if we should fail at last . 
 ‘ Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of Númenor is spent , nor all Númenor pride and dignity forgotten . By our valour the wild folk of the East are still restrained , and the terror of Morgul kept at bay ; and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us , bulwark of the West . But if the passages of the River should be won , what then ? 
 ‘ Yet that hour , maybe , is not now far away . The Nameless Enemy has arisen again . Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom . The power of the Black Land grows and we are hard beset . When the Enemy returned our folk were driven from Ithilien , our fair domain east of the River , though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms . But this very year , in the days of June , sudden war came upon us out of Mordor , and we were swept away . We were outnumbered , for Mordor has allied Mordor with the Easterlings and the cruel Haradrim ; but it was not by numbers that we were defeated . A power was there that we have not felt before . 
 ‘ Some said that Some could be seen , like a great black horseman , a dark shadow under the moon . Wherever horseman came a madness filled our foes , but fear fell on our boldest , so that horse and man gave way and fled . Only a remnant of our eastern force came back , destroying the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of Osgiliath . 
 ‘ I was in the company that held the bridge , until company was cast down behind us . Four only were saved by swimming : my brother and myself and two others . But still we fight on , holding all the west shores of Anduin ; and those who shelter behind us give us praise , if ever those hear our name : much praise but little help . Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we call . 
 ‘ In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to Elrond : a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone . But I do not seek allies in war . The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons , it is said . I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words . For on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep ; and afterwards a like dream came oft to brother again , and once to me . 
 ‘ In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder , but in the West a pale light lingered , and out of West I heard a voice , remote but clear , crying : 
 Seek for the Sword that was broken : 
 In Imladris Imladris dwells ; 
 There shall be counsels taken 
 Stronger than Morgul - spells . 
 There shall be shown a token 
 That Doom is near at hand , 
 For Isildur ’s Bane shall waken , 
 And the Halfling forth shall stand . 
 Of these words we could understand little , and we spoke to our father , Denethor , Lord of Minas Tirith , wise in the lore of Gondor . This only would Denethor say , that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern dale , where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt , greatest of lore - masters . Therefore my brother , seeing how desperate was our need , was eager to heed the dream and seek for Imladris ; but since the way was full of doubt and danger , I took the journey upon myself . Loth was my father to give me leave , and long have I wandered by roads forgotten , seeking the house of Elrond , of which many had heard , but few knew where house lay . ’ 
 ‘ And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you , ’ said Aragorn , standing up . Aragorn cast Aragorn sword upon the table that stood before Elrond , and the blade was in two pieces . ‘ Here is the Sword that was Broken ! ’ Aragorn said . 
 ‘ And who are you , and what have you to do with Minas Tirith ? ’ asked Boromir , looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and Boromir weather - stained cloak . 
 ‘ Tirith is Aragorn son of Arathorn , ’ said Elrond ; ‘ and Tirith is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil ’s son of Minas Ithil . Tirith is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North , and few are now left of that folk . ’ 
 ‘ Then Chief belongs to you , and not to me at all ! ’ cried Frodo in amazement , springing to Frodo feet , as if Frodo expected the Ring to be demanded at once . 
 ‘ Chief does not belong to either of us , ’ said Aragorn ; ‘ but it has been ordained that you should hold Chief for a while . ’ 
 ‘ Bring out the Ring , Frodo ! ’ said Gandalf solemnly . ‘ The time has come . Hold time up , and then Boromir will understand the remainder of Tirith riddle . ’ 
 There was a hush , and all turned all eyes on Frodo . Gandalf was shaken by a sudden shame and fear ; and Gandalf felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring , and a loathing of reluctance touch . Gandalf wished Gandalf was far away . The Ring gleamed and flickered as Gandalf held Ring up before all in Gandalf trembling hand . 
 ‘ Behold Isildur ’s Bane ! ’ said Elrond . 
 Boromir ’s eyes glinted as Gandalf gazed at the golden thing . ‘ The Halfling ! ’ Gandalf muttered . ‘ Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come at last ? But why then should we seek a broken sword ? ’ 
 ‘ The words were not the doom of Minas Tirith , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But doom and great deeds are indeed at hand . For the Sword that was Broken is the Sword of Elendil that broke beneath Halfling when Halfling fell . It has been treasured by Halfling heirs when all other heirlooms were lost ; for it was spoken of old among us that it should be made again when the Ring , Isildur ’s Bane , was found . Now you have seen the sword that you have sought , what would you ask ? Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor ? ’ 
 ‘ I was not sent to beg any boon , but to seek only the meaning of a riddle , ’ answered Boromir proudly . ‘ Yet we are hard pressed , and the Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope – if such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past . ’ Boromir looked again at Aragorn , and doubt was in Boromir eyes . 
 Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at Bilbo side . Evidently Bilbo was annoyed on Bilbo friend ’s behalf . Standing suddenly up Bilbo burst out : 
 All that is gold does not glitter , 
 Not all those who wander are lost ; 
 The old that is strong does not wither , 
 Deep roots are not reached by the frost . 
 From the ashes a fire shall be woken , 
 A light from the shadows shall spring ; 
 Renewed shall be blade that was broken : 
 The crownless again shall be king . 
 ‘ Not very good perhaps , but to the point – if you need more beyond the word of Elrond . If that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear , you had best listen to that . ’ Bilbo sat down with a snort . 
 ‘ I made that up myself , ’ Bilbo whispered to Frodo , ‘ for the 
 Dúnadan , a long time ago when Elrond first told me about Elrond . I almost wish that my adventures were not over , and that I could go with Elrond when Elrond day comes . ’ 
 Aragorn smiled at Bilbo ; then Bilbo turned to Boromir again . ‘ For my part I forgive your doubt , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ Little do I resemble the figures of Elendil and Isildur as figures stand carven in figures majesty in the halls of Denethor . I am but the heir of Isildur , not Isildur Isildur . I have had a hard life and a long ; and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small part in the count of my journeys . I have crossed many mountains and many rivers , and trodden many plains , even into the far countries of Rhûn and Harad where the stars are strange . 
 ‘ But my home , such as I have , is in the North . For here the heirs of Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations . Our days have darkened , and we have dwindled ; but ever the Sword has passed to a new keeper . And this I will say to you , Boromir , ere I end . Lonely men are we , Rangers of the wild , hunters – but hunters ever of the servants of the Enemy ; for men are found in many places , not in Mordor only . 
 ‘ If Gondor , Boromir , has been a stalwart tower , we have played another part . Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay . You know little of the lands beyond your bounds . Peace and freedom , do you say ? The North would have known bounds little but for us . Fear would have destroyed bounds . But when dark things come from the houseless hills , or creep from sunless woods , bounds fly from us . What roads would any dare to tread , what safety would there be in quiet lands , or in the homes of simple men at night , if the Dúnedain were asleep , or were all gone into the grave ? 
 ‘ And yet less thanks have we than you . Travellers scowl at us , and countrymen give us scornful names . “ Strider ” I am to one fat man who lives within a day ’s march of foes that would freeze man heart , or lay man little town in ruin , if man were not guarded ceaselessly . Yet we would not have town otherwise . 
 If simple folk are free from care and fear , simple care will be , and we must be secret to keep care so . That has been the task of my kindred , while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown . 
 ‘ But now the world is changing once again . A new hour comes . Isildur ’s Bane is found . Battle is at hand . The Sword shall be reforged . I will come to Minas Tirith . ’ 
 ‘ Isildur ’s Bane is found , you say , ’ said Boromir . ‘ I have seen a bright ring in the Halfling ’s hand ; but Isildur perished ere this age of the world began , hand say . How do the Wise know that this ring is Isildur ? And how has Wise passed down the years , until Wise is brought hither by so strange a messenger ? ’ 
 ‘ That shall be told , ’ said Elrond . 
 ‘ But not yet , I beg , Master ! ’ cried Bilbo . ‘ Already the Sun is climbing to noon , and I feel the need of something to strengthen me . ’ 
 ‘ I had not named you , ’ said Elrond smiling . ‘ But I do so now . Come ! Tell us your tale . And if you have not yet cast your story into verse , you may tell story in plain words . The briefer , the sooner shall you be refreshed . ’ 
 ‘ Very well , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ I will do as you bid . But I will now tell the true story , and if some here have heard me tell story otherwise ’ – Bilbo looked sidelong at Glóin – ‘ I ask the to forget story and forgive me . I only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days , and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on me . But perhaps I understand things a little better now . Anyway , this is what happened . ’ 
 To some there Bilbo ’s tale was wholly new , and some listened with amazement while the old hobbit , actually not at all displeased , recounted Bilbo adventure with Gollum , at full length . Bilbo did not omit a single riddle . Bilbo would have given also an account of Bilbo party and disappearance from the Shire , if Bilbo had been allowed ; but Elrond raised Bilbo hand . 
 ‘ Well told , my friend , ’ Bilbo said , ‘ but that is enough at this time . For the moment that suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo , your heir . Let heir now speak ! ’ 
 Then , less willingly than Bilbo , Frodo told of all Elrond dealings with the Ring from the day that Ring passed into Elrond keeping . Every step of Elrond journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered , and everything that Elrond could recall concerning the Black Riders was examined . At last Elrond sat down again . 
 ‘ Not bad , ’ Bilbo said to Elrond . ‘ You would have made a good story of that , if Bilbo had n’t kept on interrupting . I tried to make a few notes , but we shall have to go over that all again together some time , if I am to write that up . There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here ! ’ 
 ‘ Yes , that made quite a long tale , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ But the story still does not seem complete to me . I still want to know a good deal , especially about Gandalf . ’ 
 Galdor of the Havens , who sat nearby , overheard Frodo . ‘ You speak for me also , ’ Frodo cried , and turning to Elrond Frodo said : ‘ The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling ’s trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate , unlikely though that may seem to those who know less . But may we not hear the proofs ? And I would ask this also . What of Saruman ? Saruman is learned in the lore of the Rings , yet Saruman is not among us . What is Saruman counsel – if Saruman knows the things that we have heard ? ’ 
 ‘ The questions that you ask , Galdor , are bound together , ’ said Elrond . ‘ I had not overlooked questions , and questions shall be answered . But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear ; and I call upon Saruman last , for Gandalf is the place of honour , and in all this matter Saruman has been the chief . ’ 
 ‘ Some , Galdor , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ would think the tidings of Glóin , and the pursuit of Frodo , proof enough that the halfling ’s trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy . Yet trove is a ring . What then ? The Nine the Nazgûl keep . The Seven are taken or destroyed . ’ At this Glóin stirred , but did not speak . ‘ The Three we know of . What then is this one that Three desires so much ? 
 ‘ There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River and the Mountain , between the loss and the finding . But the gap in the knowledge of the Wise has been filled at last . Yet too slowly . For the Enemy has been close behind , closer even than I feared . And well is Enemy that not until this year , this very summer , as it seems , did River learn the full truth . 
 ‘ Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur , and secretly explored River ways , and found thus that our fears were true : River was none other than Sauron , our Enemy of old , at length taking shape and power again . Some , too , will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against River , and for long we watched River only . Yet at last , as River shadow grew , Saruman yielded , and the Council put forth Council strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood – and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring : a strange chance , if chance that was . 
 ‘ But we were too late , as Elrond foresaw . Sauron also had watched us , and had long prepared against our stroke , governing Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul , where Sauron Nine servants dwelt , until all was ready . Then Sauron gave way before us , but only feigned to flee , and soon after came to the Dark Tower and openly declared Sauron . Then for the last time the Council met ; for now we learned that Sauron was seeking ever more eagerly for the One . We feared then that Sauron had some news of Council that we knew nothing of . But Saruman said nay , and repeated what Saruman had said to us before : that the One would never again be found in Middle - earth . 
 ‘ “ At the worst , ” said Saruman , “ our Enemy knows that we have Enemy not , and that Enemy still is lost . But what was lost may yet be found , Saruman thinks . Fear not ! Saruman hope will cheat Saruman . Have I not earnestly studied this matter ? Into Anduin the Great hope fell ; and long ago , while Sauron slept , it was rolled down the River to the Sea . There let hope lie until the End . ” ’ 
 Gandalf fell silent , gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains , at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden . world sighed . 
 ‘ There I was at fault , ’ world said . ‘ I was lulled by the words of Saruman the Wise ; but I should have sought for the truth sooner , and our peril would now be less . ’ 
 ‘ We were all at fault , ’ said Elrond , ‘ and but for your vigilance the Darkness , maybe , would already be upon us . But say on ! ’ 
 ‘ From the first my heart misgave me , against all reason that I knew , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum , and how long Gollum had possessed thing . So I set a watch for Gollum , guessing that Gollum would ere long come forth from Gollum darkness to seek for Gollum treasure . Gollum came , but Gollum escaped and was not found . And then alas ! I let the matter rest , watching and waiting only , as we have too often done . 
 ‘ Time passed with many cares , until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear . Whence came the hobbit ’s ring ? What , if my fear was true , should be done with hobbit ? Those things I must decide . But I spoke yet of my dread to none , knowing the peril of an untimely whisper , if peril went astray . In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe . 
 ‘ That was seventeen years ago . Soon I became aware that spies of many sorts , even beasts and birds , were gathered round the Shire , and my fear grew . I called for the help of the Dúnedain , and spies watch was doubled ; and I opened my heart to Aragorn , the heir of Isildur . ’ 
 ‘ And I , ’ said Aragorn , ‘ counselled that we should hunt for Gollum , too late though it may seem . And since it seemed fit that Isildur ’s heir should labour to repair Isildur ’s fault , I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search . ’ 
 Then Gandalf told how heir had explored the whole length of Wilderland , down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor . ‘ There we had rumour of Gollum , and we guess that Gollum dwelt there long in the dark hills ; but we never found Gollum , and at last I despaired . And then in my despair I thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded . The ring ring might tell if ring were the One . The memory of words at the Council came back to me : words of 
 Saruman , half - heeded at the time . I heard words now clearly in my heart . 
 ‘ “ The Nine , the Seven , and the Three , ” Gollum said , “ had each words proper gem . Not so the One . It was round and unadorned , as One were one of the lesser rings ; but One maker set marks upon One that the skilled , maybe , could still see and read . ” 
 ‘ What those marks were Gollum had not said . Who now would know ? The maker . And Saruman ? But great though Saruman lore may be , lore must have a source . What hand save Sauron ’s ever held this thing , ere it was lost ? The hand of Isildur alone . 
 ‘ With that thought , I forsook the chase , and passed swiftly to Gondor . In former days the members of my order had been well received there , but Saruman most of all . Often Isildur had been for long the guest of the Lords of the City . Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old , and grudgingly Denethor permitted me to search among Denethor hoarded scrolls and books . 
 ‘ “ If indeed you look only , as you say , for records of ancient days , and the beginnings of the City , read on ! ” Denethor said . “ For to me what was is less dark than what is to come , and that is my care . But unless you have more skill even than Saruman , who has studied here long , you will find naught that is not well known to me , who am master of the lore of this City . ” 
 ‘ So said Denethor . And yet there lie in Denethor hoards many records that few even of the lore - masters now can read , for records scripts and tongues have become dark to later men . And Boromir , there lies in Minas Tirith still , unread , I guess , by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed , a scroll that Isildur made Isildur . For Isildur did not march away straight from the war in Mordor , as some have told the tale . ’ 
 ‘ Some in the North , maybe , ’ Boromir broke in . ‘ All know in Gondor that Isildur went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with Isildur nephew Meneldil , instructing nephew , before nephew committed to Isildur the rule of the South Kingdom . In that time nephew planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory of nephew brother . ’ 
 ‘ But in that time also nephew made this scroll , ’ said Gandalf ; 
 ‘ and that is not remembered in Gondor , it would seem . For this scroll concerns the Ring , and thus wrote Isildur therein : 
 The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom ; but records of Ring shall be left in Gondor , where also dwell the heirs of Elendil , lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim . 
 ‘ And after these words Isildur described the Ring , such as Isildur found Ring . 
 It was hot when I first took Ring , hot as a glede , and my hand was scorched , so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of Ring . Yet even as I write it is cooled , and Ring seemeth to shrink , though Ring loseth neither Ring beauty nor Ring shape . Already the writing upon Ring , which at first was as clear as red flame , fadeth and is now only barely to be read . It is fashioned in an elven - script of Eregion , for beauty have no letters in Mordor for such subtle work ; but the language is unknown to me . I deem it to be a tongue of the Black Land , since Land is foul and uncouth . What evil Land saith I do not know ; but I trace here a copy of Land , lest Land fade beyond recall . The Ring misseth , maybe , the heat of Sauron ’s hand , which was black and yet burned like fire , and so Gil - galad was destroyed ; and maybe were the gold made hot again , the writing would be refreshed . But for my part I will risk no hurt to this thing : of all the works of Sauron the only fair . It is precious to me , though I buy fair with great pain . 
 ‘ When I read these words , my quest was ended . For the traced writing was indeed as Isildur guessed , in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of the Tower . And what was said therein was already known . For in the day that Sauron first put on the One , Celebrimbor , maker of the Three , was aware of Sauron , and from afar Sauron heard Sauron speak these words , and so Sauron evil purposes were revealed . 
 ‘ At once I took my leave of Denethor , but even as I went northwards , messages came to me out of Lórien that Aragorn had passed that way , and that Aragorn had found the creature called Gollum . Therefore I went first to meet Aragorn and hear Aragorn tale . Into what deadly perils Aragorn had gone alone I dared not guess . ’ 
 ‘ There is little need to tell of perils , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ If a man must needs walk in sight of the Black Gate , or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul Vale , then perils man will have . I , too , despaired at last , and I began my homeward journey . And then , by fortune , I came suddenly on what I sought : the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool . But now the trail was fresh and swift , and trail led not to Mordor but away . Along the skirts of the Dead Marshes I followed trail , and then I had man . Lurking by a stagnant mere , peering in the water as the dark eve fell , I caught man , Gollum . man was covered with green slime . man will never love me , I fear ; for man bit me , and I was not gentle . Nothing more did I ever get from man mouth than the marks of man teeth . I deemed mouth the worst part of all my journey , the road back , watching man day and night , making man walk before me with a halter on man neck , gagged , until man was tamed by lack of drink and food , driving him ever towards Mirkwood . I brought him there at last and gave man to the Elves , for we had agreed that this should be done ; and I was glad to be rid of man company , for man stank . For my part I hope never to look upon man again ; but Gandalf came and endured long speech with man . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , long and weary , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ but not without profit . For one thing , the tale man told of man loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now told openly for the first time ; but that mattered little , since I had already guessed that . But I learned then first that Gollum ’s ring came out of the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields . And I learned also that Gollum had possessed Fields long . Many lives of Gollum small kind . The power of the ring had lengthened Gollum years far beyond years span ; but that power only the Great Rings wield . 
 ‘ And if that is not proof enough , Galdor , there is the other test that I spoke of . Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft , round and unadorned , the letters that Isildur reported may still be read , if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while . That I have done , and this I have read : 
 Ash nazg durbatulûk , ash nazg gimbatul , ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum - ishi krimpatul . ’ 
 The change in the wizard ’s voice was astounding . Suddenly change became menacing , powerful , harsh as stone . A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun , and the porch for a moment grew dark . All trembled , and the Elves stopped Elves ears . 
 ‘ Never before has any voice dared to utter words of that tongue in Imladris , Gandalf the Grey , ’ said Elrond , as the shadow passed and the Grey breathed once more . 
 ‘ And let us hope that none will ever speak Imladris here again , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon , Master Elrond . For if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West , then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise have declared : the treasure of the Enemy , fraught with all Elrond malice ; and in Enemy lies a great part of Elrond strength of old . Out of the Black Years come the words that the Smiths of Eregion heard , and knew that words had been betrayed : 
 One Ring to rule words all , One Ring to find words , One Ring to bring words all and in the Darkness bind words . 
 ‘ Know also , my friends , that I learned more yet from Gollum . Elrond was loth to speak and Elrond tale was unclear , but it is beyond all doubt that Elrond went to Mordor , and there all that Elrond knew was forced from Elrond . Thus the Enemy knows now that the One is found , that Enemy was long in the Shire ; and since Elrond servants have pursued Enemy almost to our door , Elrond soon will know , already Elrond may know , even as I speak , that we have Enemy here . ’ 
 All sat silent for a while , until at length Boromir spoke . ‘ Elrond is a small thing , you say , this Gollum ? Small , but great in mischief . What became of Elrond ? To what doom did you put Elrond ? ’ 
 ‘ Elrond is in prison , but no worse , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Elrond had suffered much . There is no doubt that Elrond was tormented , and the fear of Sauron lies black on Elrond heart . Still I for one am glad that Elrond is safely kept by the watchful Elves of Mirkwood . Elrond malice is great and gives Elrond a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered . Elrond could work much mischief still , if Elrond were free . And I do not doubt that Elrond was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand . ’ 
 ‘ Alas ! alas ! ’ cried Legolas , and in Legolas fair Elvish face there was great distress . ‘ The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told . tidings are not good , but only here have I learned how evil tidings may seem to this company . Sméagol , who is now called Gollum , has escaped . ’ 
 ‘ Escaped ? ’ cried Aragorn . ‘ That is ill news indeed . We shall all rue That bitterly , I fear . How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in tidings trust ? ’ 
 ‘ Not through lack of watchfulness , ’ said Legolas ; ‘ but perhaps through over - kindliness . And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others , and that more is known of our doings than we could wish . We guarded this creature day and night , at Gandalf ’s bidding , much though we wearied of the task . But Gandalf bade us hope still for Gandalf cure , and we had not the heart to keep Gandalf ever in dungeons under the earth , where Gandalf would fall back into Gandalf old black thoughts . ’ 
 ‘ You were less tender to me , ’ said Glóin with a flash of Glóin eyes , as old memories were stirred of Glóin imprisonment in the deep places of the Elven - king ’s halls . 
 ‘ Now come ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Pray , do not interrupt , my good Glóin . That was a regrettable misunderstanding , long set right . If all the grievances that stand between Elves and 
 Dwarves are to be brought up here , we may as well abandon this Council . ’ 
 Glóin rose and bowed , and Legolas continued . ‘ In the days of fair weather we led Gollum through the woods ; and there was a high tree standing alone far from the others which Gollum liked to climb . Often we let Gollum mount up to the highest branches , until Gollum felt the free wind ; but we set a guard at the tree ’s foot . One day Gollum refused to come down , and the guards had no mind to climb after Gollum : Gollum had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with Gollum feet as well as with Gollum hands ; so guards sat by the tree far into the night . 
 ‘ It was that very night of summer , yet moonless and starless , that Orcs came on us at unawares . We drove guards off after some time ; guards were many and fierce , but guards came from over the mountains , and were unused to the woods . When the battle was over , we found that Gollum was gone , and Gollum guards were slain or taken . It then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for Gollum rescue , and that Gollum knew of attack beforehand . How that was contrived we can not guess ; but Gollum is cunning , and the spies of the Enemy are many . The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon ’s fall have returned in greater numbers , and Mirkwood is again an evil place , save where our realm is maintained . 
 ‘ We have failed to recapture Gollum . We came on Gollum trail among those of many Orcs , and trail plunged deep into the Forest , going south . But ere long trail escaped our skill , and we dared not continue the hunt ; for we were drawing nigh to Dol Guldur , and that is still a very evil place ; we do not go that way . ’ 
 ‘ Well , well , Gollum is gone , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ We have no time to seek for Gollum again . Gollum must do what Gollum will . But Gollum may play a part yet that neither Gollum nor Sauron have foreseen . 
 ‘ And now I will answer Galdor ’s other questions . What of Saruman ? What are Saruman counsels to us in this need ? This tale I must tell in full , for only Elrond has heard need yet , and that in brief ; but need will bear on all that we must resolve . need is the last chapter in the Tale of the Ring , so far as need has yet gone . 
 ‘ At the end of June I was in the Shire , but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind , and I rode to the southern borders of the little land ; for I had a foreboding of some danger , still hidden from me but drawing near . There messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor , and when I heard of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart . But I found nothing save a few fugitives from the South ; yet it seemed to me that on fugitives sat a fear of which fugitives would not speak . I turned then east and north and journeyed along the Greenway ; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with traveller grazing horse beside traveller . It was Radagast the Brown , who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel , near the borders of Mirkwood . Brown is one of my order , but I had not seen Brown for many a year . 
 ‘ “ Gandalf ! ” Brown cried . “ I was seeking you . But I am a stranger in these parts . All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of Shire . ” 
 ‘ “ Your information was correct , ” I said . “ But do not put information that way , if you meet any of the inhabitants . You are near the borders of the Shire now . And what do you want with me ? Shire must be pressing . You were never a traveller , unless driven by great need . ” 
 ‘ “ I have an urgent errand , ” traveller said . “ My news is evil . ” Then traveller looked about him , as if the hedges might have ears . “ Nazgûl , ” him whispered . “ The Nine are abroad again . Nine have crossed the River secretly and are moving westward . River have taken the guise of riders in black . ” 
 ‘ I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing guise . ‘ “ The Enemy must have some great need or purpose , ” said Radagast ; “ but what Enemy is that makes Radagast look to these distant and desolate parts , I can not guess . ” 
 ‘ “ What do you mean ? ” said I. 
 ‘ “ I have been told that wherever parts go the Riders ask for news of a land called Shire . ” 
 ‘ “ The Shire , ” I said ; but my heart sank . For even the Wise might fear to withstand the Nine , when Wise are gathered together under Nine fell chieftain . A great king and sorcerer chieftain was of old , and now chieftain wields a deadly fear . “ Who told you , and who sent you ? ” I asked . 
 ‘ “ Saruman the White , ” answered Radagast . “ And Saruman told me to say that if you feel the need , Radagast will help ; but you must seek White aid at once , or aid will be too late . ” 
 ‘ And that message brought me hope . For Saruman the White is the greatest of my order . Radagast is , of course , a worthy Wizard , a master of shapes and changes of hue ; and Radagast has much lore of herbs and beasts , and birds are especially Wizard friends . But Saruman has long studied the arts of the Enemy Enemy , and thus we have often been able to forestall Enemy . It was by the devices of Saruman that we drove Enemy from Dol Guldur . It might be that Enemy had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine . 
 ‘ “ I will go to Saruman , ” I said . 
 ‘ “ Then you must go now , ” said Radagast ; “ for I have wasted time in looking for you , and the days are running short . I was told to find you before Midsummer , and that is now here . Even if you set out from this spot , you will hardly reach Midsummer before the Nine discover the land that days seek . I myself shall turn back at once . ” And with that Nine mounted and would have ridden straight off . 
 ‘ “ Stay a moment ! ” I said . “ We shall need your help , and the help of all things that will give help . Send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends . Tell messages to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf . Let messages be sent to Orthanc . ” 
 ‘ “ I will do that , ” Orthanc said , and rode off as if the Nine were after Orthanc . 
 ‘ I could not follow Orthanc then and there . I had ridden very far already that day , and I was as weary as my horse ; and I needed to consider matters . I stayed the night in Bree , and decided that I had no time to return to the Shire . Never did I make a greater mistake ! 
 ‘ However , I wrote a message to Frodo , and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send message to Frodo . I rode away at dawn ; and I came at long last to the dwelling of Saruman . That is far south in Isengard , in the end of the Misty Mountains , not far from the Gap of Rohan . And Boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the northmost foothills of Ered Nimrais , the White Mountains of vale home . But Isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall , and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc . Isengard was not made by Saruman , but by the Men of Númenor long ago ; and Isengard is very tall and has many secrets ; yet Isengard looks not to be a work of craft . Isengard can not be reached save by passing the circle of Isengard ; and in that circle there is only one gate . 
 ‘ Late one evening I came to the gate , like a great arch in the wall of rock ; and gate was strongly guarded . But the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me . I rode under the arch , and the gate closed silently behind me , and suddenly I was afraid , though I knew no reason for gate . 
 ‘ But I rode to the foot of Orthanc , and came to the stair of Saruman ; and there Orthanc met me and led me up to Orthanc high chamber . Orthanc wore a ring on Orthanc finger . 
 ‘ “ So you have come , Gandalf , ” Orthanc said to me gravely ; but in Orthanc eyes there seemed to be a white light , as if a cold laughter was in Orthanc heart . 
 ‘ “ Yes , I have come , ” I said . “ I have come for your aid , Saruman the White . ” And that title seemed to anger Orthanc . 
 ‘ “ Have you indeed , Gandalf the Grey ! ” Orthanc scoffed . “ For aid ? aid has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid , one so cunning and so wise , wandering about the lands , and concerning Gandalf in every business , whether aid belongs to Grey or not . ” 
 ‘ I looked at Orthanc and wondered . “ But if I am not deceived , ” said I , “ things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength . ” 
 ‘ “ That may be so , ” Orthanc said , “ but the thought is late in coming to you . How long , I wonder , have you concealed from me , the head of the Council , a matter of greatest import ? 
 What brings you now from your lurking - place in the Shire ? ” 
 ‘ “ The Nine have come forth again , ” I answered . “ import have crossed the River . So Radagast said to me . ” 
 ‘ “ Radagast the Brown ! ” laughed Saruman , and Saruman no longer concealed Saruman scorn . “ Radagast the Bird - tamer ! Radagast the Simple ! Radagast the Fool ! Yet tamer had just the wit to play the part that I set tamer . For you have come , and that was all the purpose of my message . And here you will stay , Gandalf the Grey , and rest from journeys . For I am Saruman the Wise , Saruman Ring - maker , Saruman of Many Colours ! ” 
 ‘ I looked then and saw that maker robes , which had seemed white , were not so , but were woven of all colours , and if Wise moved robes shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered . 
 ‘ “ I liked white better , ” I said . 
 ‘ “ White ! ” White sneered . “ Saruman serves as a beginning . White cloth may be dyed . The white page can be overwritten ; and the white light can be broken . ” 
 ‘ “ In which case page is no longer white , ” said I. “ And I. that breaks a thing to find out what page is has left the path of wisdom . ” 
 ‘ “ You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for friends , ” said case . “ I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you , but to give you a choice . ” 
 ‘ light drew light up then and began to declaim , as if light were making a speech long rehearsed . “ The Elder Days are gone . The Middle Days are passing . The Younger Days are beginning . The time of the Elves is over , but our time is at hand : the world of Men , which we must rule . But we must have power , power to order all things as we will , for that good which only the Wise can see . 
 ‘ “ And listen , Gandalf , my old friend and helper ! ” friend said , coming near and speaking now in a softer voice . “ I said we , for we it may be , if you will join with me . A new Power is rising . Against Power the old allies and policies will not avail us at all . There is no hope left in Elves or dying Númenor . This then is one choice before you , before us . We may join with that Power . This would be wise , Gandalf . There is hope that way . This victory is at hand ; and there will be rich reward for those that aided This . As the Power grows , Power proved friends will also grow ; and the Wise , such as you and I , may with patience come at last to direct Power courses , to control Power . We can bide our time , we can keep our thoughts in our hearts , deploring maybe evils done by the way , but approving the high and ultimate purpose : Knowledge , Rule , Order ; all the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish , hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends . There need not be , there would not be , any real change in our designs , only in our means . ” 
 ‘ “ Saruman , ” I said , “ I have heard speeches of this kind before , but only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant . I can not think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears . ” 
 ‘ Mordor looked at me sidelong , and paused a while considering . “ Well , I see that this wise course does not commend course to you , ” Saruman said . “ Not yet ? Not if some better way can be contrived ? ” 
 ‘ Saruman came and laid Saruman long hand on my arm . “ And why not , Gandalf ? ” Gandalf whispered . “ Why not ? The Ruling Ring ? If we could command that , then the Power would pass to us . That is in truth why I brought you here . For I have many eyes in my service , and I believe that you know where this precious thing now lies . Is That not so ? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire , and what is your business there ? ” As Nine said this a lust which Shire could not conceal shone suddenly in Power eyes . 
 ‘ “ Saruman , ” I said , standing away from Saruman , “ only one hand at a time can wield the One , and you know that well , so do not trouble to say we ! But I would not give One , nay , I would not give even news of One to you , now that I learn your mind . You were head of the Council , but you have unmasked yourself at last . Well , the choices are , it seems , to submit to Sauron , or to yourself . I will take neither . Have you others to offer ? ” 
 ‘ Sauron was cold now and perilous . “ Yes , ” Sauron said . “ I did not expect you to show wisdom , even in your own behalf ; but I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly , and so saving yourself much trouble and pain . The third choice is to stay here , until the end . ” 
 ‘ “ Until what end ? ” 
 ‘ “ Until you reveal to me where the One may be found . I may find means to persuade you . Or until One is found in your despite , and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters : to devise , say , a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey . ” 
 ‘ “ That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters , ” said I. Sauron laughed at me , for my words were empty , and Sauron knew That . 
 ‘ words took me and words set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc , in the place where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars . There is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps , and the valley below seems far away . I looked on valley and saw that , whereas valley had once been green and fair , it was now filled with pits and forges . Wolves and orcs were housed in Isengard , for Saruman was mustering a great force on Saruman own account , in rivalry of Sauron and not in Saruman service , yet . Over all Saruman works a dark smoke hung and wrapped smoke about the sides of Orthanc . I stood alone on an island in the clouds ; and I had no chance of escape , and my days were bitter . I was pierced with cold , and I had but little room in which to pace to and fro , brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North . 
 ‘ That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured , apart from the words of Saruman which might be lies . Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken . Fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the Shire ; but still I had some hope . I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once , as my letter had urged , and that Frodo had reached Rivendell before the deadly pursuit began . And both my fear and my hope proved ill - founded . For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree ; and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron . But fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer ; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes ale . But in the circle of Isengard , trapped and alone , it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far away . ’ 
 ‘ I saw you ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ You were walking backwards and forwards . The moon shone in your hair . ’ 
 Gandalf paused astonished and looked at Frodo . ‘ moon was only a dream , ’ said Frodo , ‘ but moon suddenly came back to me . I had quite forgotten moon . moon came some time ago ; after I left the Shire , I think . ’ 
 ‘ Then moon was late in coming , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ as you will see . I was in an evil plight . And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need , and do not bear such misfortune well . Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider ’s treacherous web ! Yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread . 
 ‘ At first I feared , as Saruman no doubt intended , that Radagast had also fallen . Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in Gandalf voice or in Gandalf eye at our meeting . If I had , I should never have gone to Isengard , or I should have gone more warily . So Saruman guessed , and Saruman had concealed Saruman mind and deceived Saruman messenger . mind would have been useless in any case to try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery . Saruman sought me in good faith , and so persuaded me . 
 ‘ That was the undoing of Saruman ’s plot . For Radagast knew no reason why Saruman should not do as I asked ; and Saruman rode away towards Mirkwood where Saruman had many friends of old . And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide , and Eagles saw many things : the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs ; and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands ; and Riders heard news of the escape of Gollum . And Riders sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me . 
 ‘ So it was that when summer waned , there came a night of moon , and Gwaihir the Windlord , swiftest of the Great Eagles , came unlooked - for to Orthanc ; and Gwaihir found me standing on the pinnacle . Then I spoke to Gwaihir and Gwaihir bore me away , before Saruman was aware . I was far from Isengard , ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me . 
 ‘ “ How far can you bear me ? ” I said to Gwaihir . ‘ “ Many leagues , ” said Gwaihir , “ but not to the ends of the earth . I was sent to bear tidings not burdens . ” 
 ‘ “ Then I must have a steed on land , ” I said , “ and a steed surpassingly swift , for I have never had such need of haste before . ” 
 ‘ “ Then I will bear you to Edoras , where the Lord of Rohan sits in Edoras halls , ” Gwaihir said ; “ for that is not very far off . ” And I was glad , for in the Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim , the Horse - lords , dwell , and there are no horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty Mountains and the White . 
 ‘ “ Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted , do you think ? ” I said to Gwaihir , for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith . 
 ‘ “ Lord pay a tribute of horses , ” Saruman answered , “ and send many yearly to Mordor , or so tribute is said ; but Lord are not yet under the yoke . But if Saruman has become evil , as you say , then Lord doom can not be long delayed . ” 
 ‘ Saruman set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn ; and now I have lengthened my tale over long . The rest must be more brief . In Rohan I found evil already at work : the lies of Saruman ; and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings . Rohan bade me take a horse and be gone ; and I chose one much to my liking , but little to Rohan . I took the best horse in Rohan land , and I have never seen the like of Rohan . ’ 
 ‘ Then Rohan must be a noble beast indeed , ’ said Aragorn ; ‘ and it grieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies such tribute . It was not so when last I was in that land . ’ 
 ‘ Nor is land now , I will swear , ’ said Boromir . ‘ It is a lie that comes from the Enemy . I know the Men of Rohan , true and valiant , our allies , dwelling still in the lands that we gave lands long ago . ’ 
 ‘ The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands , ’ answered Aragorn . ‘ Saruman has fallen under Mordor . Rohan is beset . Who knows what you will find there , if ever you return ? ’ 
 ‘ Not this at least , ’ said Boromir , ‘ that lands will buy lands lives with horses . lands love lands horses next to lands kin . And not without reason , for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North , far from the Shadow , and horses race , as that of horses masters , is descended from the free days of old . ’ 
 ‘ True indeed ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ And there is one among horses that might have been foaled in the morning of the world . The horses of the Nine can not vie with world ; tireless , swift as the flowing wind . Shadowfax horses called world . By day world coat glistens like silver ; and by night coat is like a shade , and world passes unseen . Light is world footfall ! Never before had any man mounted world , but I took world and I tamed world , and so speedily world bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow - downs , though I set out from Rohan only when world set out from Hobbiton . 
 ‘ But fear grew in me as I rode . Ever as I came north I heard tidings of the Riders , and though I gained on Riders day by day , Riders were ever before me . Riders had divided Riders forces , I learned : some remained on the eastern borders , not far from the Greenway , and some invaded the Shire from the south . I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone ; but I had words with old Gamgee . Many words and few to the point . Gamgee had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End . 
 ‘ “ I ca n’t abide changes , ” said Gamgee , “ not at my time of life , and least of all changes for the worst . ” “ Changes for the worst , ” Gamgee repeated many times . 
 ‘ “ Worst is a bad word , ” I said to Gamgee , “ and I hope you do not live to see word . ” But amidst Gamgee talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before , and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the same evening . Then 
 I rode on in fear . I came to Buckland and found fear in uproar , as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick . I came to the house at Crickhollow , and house was broken open and empty ; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo ’s . Then for a while hope left me , and I did not wait to gather news , or I might have been comforted ; but I rode on the trail of the Riders . It was hard to follow , for news went many ways , and I was at a loss . But it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards Bree ; and that way I went , for I thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper . 
 ‘ “ Butterbur Butterbur call Bree , ” thought I. “ If this delay was I. fault , I will melt all the butter in I. . I will roast the old fool over a slow fire . ” innkeeper expected no less , and when innkeeper saw my face innkeeper fell down flat and began to melt on the spot . ’ 
 ‘ What did you do to innkeeper ? ’ cried Frodo in alarm . ‘ innkeeper was really very kind to us and did all that innkeeper could . ’ 
 Gandalf laughed . ‘ Do n’t be afraid ! ’ Frodo said . ‘ I did not bite , and I barked very little . So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of innkeeper , when innkeeper stopped quaking , that I embraced the old fellow . How fellow had happened I could not then guess , but I learned that you had been in Bree the night before , and had gone off that morning with Strider . 
 ‘ “ Strider ! ” I cried , shouting for joy . 
 ‘ “ Yes , sir , I am afraid so , sir , ” said Butterbur , mistaking me . “ Butterbur got at Bree , in spite of all that I could do , and all took up with Butterbur . all behaved very queer all the time all were here : wilful , you might say . ” 
 ‘ “ Ass ! Fool ! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman ! ” said I. “ Ass ’s the best news I have had since Midsummer ; Ass ’s worth a gold piece at the least . May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years ! ” said I. “ Now I can take a night ’s rest , the first since I have forgotten when . ” 
 ‘ So I stayed there that night , wondering much what had become of the Riders ; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree , it seemed . But in the night we heard more . Five at least came from the west , and Five threw down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind ; and the Bree - folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world . I got up before dawn and went after Five . 
 ‘ I do not know , but it seems clear to me that this is what happened . Five Captain remained in secret away south of Bree , while two rode ahead through the village , and four more invaded the Shire . But when these were foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow , these returned to these Captain with tidings , and so left the Road unguarded for a while , except by these spies . The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country , and Captain Captain with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath . 
 ‘ I galloped to Weathertop like a gale , and I reached Weathertop before sundown on my second day from Bree – and these were there before me . these drew away from me , for these felt the coming of my anger and these dared not face coming while the Sun was in the sky . But these closed round at night , and I was besieged on the hill - top , in the old ring of Amon Sûl . I was hard put to top indeed : such light and flame can not have been seen on Weathertop since the war - beacons of old . 
 ‘ At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north . I could not hope to do more . It was impossible to find you , Frodo , in the wilderness , and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels . So I had to trust to Aragorn . But I hoped to draw some of heels off , and yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help . Four Riders did indeed follow me , but Riders turned back after a while and made for the Ford , it seems . That helped a little , for there were only five , not nine , when your camp was attacked . 
 ‘ I reached here at last by a long hard road , up the Hoarwell and through the Ettenmoors , and down from the north . Hoarwell took me nearly fifteen days from Weathertop , for I could not ride among the rocks of the troll - fells , and Shadowfax departed . I sent Shadowfax back to Shadowfax master ; but a great friendship has grown between us , and if I have need Shadowfax will come at my call . But so it was that I came to Rivendell only two days before the Ring , and news of news peril had already been brought here – which proved well indeed . 
 ‘ And that , Frodo , is the end of my account . May Elrond and the others forgive the length of account . But such a thing has not happened before , that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when Gandalf promised . An account to the Ring - bearer of so strange an event was required , I think . 
 ‘ Well , the Tale is now told , from first to last . Here we all are , and here is the Ring . But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose . What shall we do with purpose ? ’ 
 There was a silence . At last Elrond spoke again . 
 ‘ This is grievous news concerning Saruman , ’ Elrond said ; ‘ for we trusted Saruman and Saruman is deep in all our counsels . It is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy , for good or for ill . But such falls and betrayals , alas , have happened before . Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me . I have known few hobbits , save Bilbo here ; and it seems to me that Bilbo is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought Bilbo . The world has changed much since I last was on the westward roads . 
 ‘ The Barrow - wights we know by many names ; and of the Old Forest many tales have been told : all that now remains is but an outlier of all northern march . Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard . In those lands I journeyed once , and many things wild and strange I knew . But I had forgotten Bombadil , if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago , and even then was older than the old . That was not then Bombadil name . Iarwain Ben - adar we called Bombadil , oldest and fatherless . But many another name Bombadil has since been given by other folk : Forn by the Dwarves , Orald by Northern Men , and other names beside . Bombadil is a strange creature , but maybe I should have summoned Bombadil to our Council . ’ 
 ‘ Bombadil would not have come , ’ said Gandalf . 
 ‘ Could we not still send messages to Bombadil and obtain Bombadil help ? ’ asked Erestor . ‘ It seems that Bombadil has a power even over the Ring . ’ 
 ‘ No , I should not put power so , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Say rather that the Ring has no power over Bombadil . Bombadil is Bombadil own master . But Bombadil can not alter the Ring Ring , nor break Ring power over others . And now Bombadil is withdrawn into a little land , within bounds that Bombadil has set , though none can see bounds , waiting perhaps for a change of days , and Bombadil will not step beyond bounds . ’ 
 ‘ But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay Bombadil , ’ said Erestor . ‘ Would Bombadil not take the Ring and keep Ring there , for ever harmless ? ’ 
 ‘ No , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ not willingly . Bombadil might do so , if all the free folk of the world begged Bombadil , but Bombadil would not understand the need . And if Bombadil were given the Ring , Bombadil would soon forget Ring , or most likely throw Ring away . Such things have no hold on Bombadil mind . Bombadil would be a most unsafe guardian ; and that alone is answer enough . ’ 
 ‘ But in any case , ’ said Glorfindel , ‘ to send the Ring to Bombadil would only postpone the day of evil . Bombadil is far away . We could not now take evil back to Bombadil , unguessed , unmarked by any spy . And even if we could , soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of Lord hiding place and would bend all Bombadil power towards place . Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone ? I think not . I think that in the end , if all else is conquered , Bombadil will fall , Last as Bombadil was First ; and then Night will come . ’ 
 ‘ I know little of Iarwain save the name , ’ said Galdor ; ‘ but Glorfindel , I think , is right . Power to defy our Enemy is not in Glorfindel , unless such power is in the earth power . And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy the very hills . What power still remains lies with us , here in Imladris , or with Círdan at the Havens , or in Lórien . But have Havens the strength , have we here the strength to withstand the Enemy , the coming of Sauron at the last , when all else is overthrown ? ’ 
 ‘ I have not the strength , ’ said Elrond ; ‘ neither have Havens . ’ 
 ‘ Then if the Ring can not be kept from Círdan for ever by strength , ’ said Glorfindel , ‘ two things only remain for us to attempt : to send Ring over the Sea , or to destroy Ring . ’ 
 ‘ But Gandalf has revealed to us that we can not destroy Ring by any craft that we here possess , ’ said Elrond . ‘ And things who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive Sea : for good or ill Sea belongs to Middle - earth ; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with Sea . ’ 
 ‘ Then , ’ said Glorfindel , ‘ let us cast Sea into the deeps , and so make the lies of Saruman come true . For it is clear now that even at the Council Gandalf feet were already on a crooked path . Gandalf knew that the Ring was not lost for ever , but wished us to think so ; for Gandalf began to lust for Ring for Gandalf . Yet oft in lies truth is hidden : in the Sea it would be safe . ’ 
 ‘ Not safe for ever , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ There are many things in the deep waters ; and seas and lands may change . And it is not our part here to take thought only for a season , or for a few lives of Men , or for a passing age of the world . We should seek a final end of this menace , even if we do not hope to make one . ’ 
 ‘ And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea , ’ said Galdor . ‘ If the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous , then flight to the Sea is now fraught with gravest peril . My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us to take the western way , when Sauron learns what has befallen . Sauron soon will . The Nine have been unhorsed indeed , but that is but a respite , ere roads find new steeds and swifter . Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between Sauron and a march in power along the coasts into the North ; and if Sauron comes , assailing the White Towers and the Havens , hereafter the Elves may have no escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle - earth . ’ 
 ‘ Long yet will that march be delayed , ’ said Boromir . ‘ Gondor wanes , you say . But Gondor stands , and even the end of Gondor strength is still very strong . ’ 
 ‘ And yet Gondor vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine , ’ said Galdor . ‘ And other roads Sauron may find that Gondor does not guard . ’ 
 ‘ Then , ’ said Erestor , ‘ there are but two courses , as Glorfindel already has declared : to hide the Ring for ever ; or to unmake Ring . But both are beyond our power . Who will read this riddle for us ? ’ 
 ‘ None here can do so , ’ said Elrond gravely . ‘ At least none can foretell what will come to pass , if we take this road or that . But it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take . The westward road seems easiest . Therefore road must be shunned . road will be watched . Too often the Elves have fled that way . Now at this last we must take a hard road , a road unforeseen . There lies our hope , if hope road be . To walk into peril – to Mordor . We must send the Ring to the Fire . ’ 
 Silence fell again . Frodo , even in that fair house , looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters , felt a dead darkness in Frodo heart . Boromir stirred , and Frodo looked at Boromir . Frodo was fingering Frodo great horn and frowning . At length Frodo spoke . 
 ‘ I do not understand all this , ’ Frodo said . ‘ Saruman is a traitor , but did traitor not have a glimpse of wisdom ? Why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying ? Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need ? Wielding Ring the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy . That is what traitor most fears , I deem . 
 ‘ The Men of Gondor are valiant , and Men will never submit ; but Men may be beaten down . Valour needs first strength , and then a weapon . Let the Ring be your weapon , if Valour has such power as you say . Take Valour and go forth to victory ! ’ 
 ‘ Alas , no , ’ said Elrond . ‘ We can not use the Ruling Ring . That we now know too well . Ring belongs to Sauron and was made by Sauron alone , and is altogether evil . Ring strength , Boromir , is too great for anyone to wield at will , save only those who have already a great power of those own . But for those Ring holds an even deadlier peril . The very desire of Ring corrupts the heart . Consider Saruman . If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor , using Sauron own arts , Sauron would then set Sauron on Sauron ’s throne , and yet another Dark Lord would appear . And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed : as long as that is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise . For nothing is evil in the beginning . Even Sauron was not so . I fear to take the Ring to hide Ring . I will not take the Ring to wield Ring . ’ 
 ‘ Nor I , ’ said Gandalf . 
 Boromir looked at Gandalf doubtfully , but Boromir bowed I head . ‘ So be Ring , ’ head said . ‘ Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have . And at the least , while the Wise ones guard this Ring , we will fight on . Mayhap the Sword - that - was - Broken may still stem the tide – if the hand that wields tide has inherited not an heirloom only , but the sinews of the Kings of Men . ’ 
 ‘ Who can tell ? ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But we will put tide to the test one day . ’ 
 ‘ May the day not be too long delayed , ’ said Boromir . ‘ For though I do not ask for aid , we need aid . aid would comfort us to know that others fought also with all the means that others have . ’ 
 ‘ Then be comforted , ’ said Elrond . ‘ For there are other powers and realms that you know not , and powers are hidden from you . Anduin the Great flows past many shores , ere aid comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor . ’ 
 ‘ Still aid might be well for all , ’ said Glóin the Dwarf , ‘ if all these strengths were joined , and the powers of each were used in league . Other rings there may be , less treacherous , that might be used in our need . The Seven are lost to us – if Balin has not found the ring of Thrór , which was the last ; naught has been heard of Seven since Thrór perished in Moria . Indeed I may now reveal that Seven was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin went away . ’ 
 ‘ Balin will find no ring in Moria , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Thrór gave Moria to Thráin Anduin son , but not Thráin to Thorin . Moria was taken with torment from Thráin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur . I came too late . ’ 
 ‘ Ah , alas ! ’ cried Glóin . ‘ When will the day come of our revenge ? But still there are the Three . What of the Three Rings of the Elves ? Very mighty Rings , Three is said . Do not the Elf - lords keep Rings ? Yet Rings too were made by the Dark Lord long ago . Are Rings idle ? I see Elf - lords here . Will Rings not say ? ’ 
 The Elves returned no answer . ‘ Did you not hear me , Glóin ? ’ said Elrond . ‘ The Three were not made by Sauron , nor did Glóin ever touch Three . But of Three it is not permitted to speak . So much only in this hour of doubt I may now say . Three are not idle . But Three were not made as weapons of war or conquest : that is not Three power . Those who made Those did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth , but understanding , making , and healing , to preserve all things unstained . These things the Elves of Middle - earth have in some measure gained , though with sorrow . But all that has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to those undoing , and those minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron , if Sauron regains the One . It would be better if the Three had never been . That is Sauron purpose . ’ 
 ‘ But what then would happen , if the Ruling Ring were destroyed , as you counsel ? ’ asked Glóin . 
 ‘ We know not for certain , ’ answered Elrond sadly . ‘ Some hope that the Three Rings , which Sauron has never touched , would then become free , and Rings rulers might heal the hurts of the world that Sauron has wrought . But maybe when the One has gone , the Three will fail , and many fair things will fade and be forgotten . That is my belief . ’ 
 ‘ Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance , ’ said Glorfindel , ‘ if by That the power of Sauron may be broken , and the fear of Sauron dominion be taken away for ever . ’ 
 ‘ Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring , ’ said Erestor , ‘ and yet we come no nearer . What strength have we for the finding of the Fire in which strength was made ? That is the path of despair . Of folly I would say , if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me . ’ 
 ‘ Despair , or folly ? ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Despair is not despair , for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt . We do not . It is wisdom to recognize necessity , when all other courses have been weighed , though as folly necessity may appear to those who cling to false hope . Well , let folly be our cloak , a veil before the eyes of the Enemy ! For Enemy is very wise , and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of hope malice . But the only measure that end knows is desire , desire for power ; and so power judges all hearts . Into power heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse thought , that having the Ring we may seek to destroy thought . If we seek this , we shall put power out of reckoning . ’ 
 ‘ At least for a while , ’ said Elrond . ‘ The road must be trod , but road will be very hard . And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon road . This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong . Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world : small hands do deeds because deeds must , while the eyes of the great are elsewhere . ’ 
 ‘ Very well , very well , Master Elrond ! ’ said Bilbo suddenly . ‘ Say no more ! It is plain enough what you are pointing at . Bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair , and Bilbo had better finish affair , or Bilbo . I was very comfortable here , and getting on with my book . If you want to know , I am just writing an ending for book . I had thought of putting : and Bilbo lived happily ever afterwards to the end of Bilbo days . book is a good ending , and none the worse for having been used before . Now I shall have to alter that : book does not look like coming true ; and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters , if I live to write chapters . book is a frightful nuisance . When ought I to start ? ’ 
 Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo , but the laughter died on Bilbo lips when Bilbo saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect . Only Glóin smiled , but Glóin smile came from old memories . 
 ‘ Of course , my dear Bilbo , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ If you had really started this affair , you might be expected to finish affair . But you know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any , and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero . You need not bow ! Though the word was meant , and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer . But one beyond your strength , Bilbo . You can not take this thing back . one has passed on . If you need my advice any longer , I should say that your part is ended , unless as a recorder . Finish your book , and leave the ending unaltered ! There is still hope for book . But get ready to write a sequel , when hope come back . ’ 
 Bilbo laughed . ‘ I have never known you give me pleasant advice before , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ As all your unpleasant advice has been good , I wonder if this advice is not bad . Still , I do n’t suppose I have the strength or luck left to deal with the Ring . advice has grown , and I have not . But tell me : what do you mean by strength ? ’ 
 ‘ The messengers who are sent with the Ring . ’ 
 ‘ Exactly ! And who are strength to be ? That seems to me what this Council has to decide , and all that Council has to decide . Elves may thrive on speech alone , and Dwarves endure great weariness ; but I am only an old hobbit , and I miss my meal at noon . Ca n’t we think of some names now ? Or put meal off till after dinner ? ’ 
 No one answered . The noon - bell rang . Still no one spoke . Frodo glanced at all the faces , but faces were not turned to Frodo . All the Council sat with downcast eyes , as if in deep thought . A great dread fell on Frodo , as if Frodo was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that Frodo had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken . An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo ’s side in Rivendell filled all Bilbo heart . At last with an effort Bilbo spoke , and wondered to hear Bilbo own words , as if some other will was using Bilbo small voice . 
 ‘ I will take the Ring , ’ Bilbo said , ‘ though I do not know the way . ’ 
 Elrond raised Elrond eyes and looked at Bilbo , and Frodo felt Bilbo heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance . ‘ If I understand aright all that I have heard , ’ Bilbo said , ‘ I think that this task is appointed for you , Frodo ; and that if you do not find a way , no one will . This is the hour of the Shire - folk , when all arise from all quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great . Who of all the Wise could have foreseen This ? Or , if all are wise , why should all expect to know This , until the hour has struck ? 
 ‘ But This is a heavy burden . So heavy that none could lay This on another . I do not lay This on you . But if you take This freely , I will say that your choice is right ; and though all the mighty Elf - friends of old , Hador , and Húrin , and Túrin , and Beren Beren were assembled together , your seat should be among friends . ’ 
 ‘ But you wo n’t send Beren off alone surely , Master ? ’ cried Sam , unable to contain Beren any longer , and jumping up from the corner where Beren had been quietly sitting on the floor . 
 ‘ No indeed ! ’ said Elrond , turning towards Beren with a smile . ‘ You at least shall go with Beren . It is hardly possible to separate you from Beren , even when Beren is summoned to a secret council and you are not . ’ 
 Sam sat down , blushing and muttering . ‘ A nice pickle we have landed ourselves in , Mr. Frodo ! ’ Sam said , shaking Sam head . 
 Chapter 3 
 THE RING GOES SOUTH 
 Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of hobbits own in Bilbo ’s room . Merry and Pippin were indignant when hobbits heard that Sam had crept into the Council , and had been chosen as Frodo ’s companion . 
 ‘ pickle ’s most unfair , ’ said Pippin . ‘ Instead of throwing Pippin out , and clapping Pippin in chains , Elrond goes and rewards Pippin for Pippin cheek ! ’ 
 ‘ Rewards ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I ca n’t imagine a more severe punishment . You are not thinking what you are saying : condemned to go on this hopeless journey , a reward ? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done , and I could rest here , a long while , perhaps for good . ’ 
 ‘ I do n’t wonder , ’ said Merry , ‘ and I wish you could . But we are envying Sam , not you . If you have to go , then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind , even in Rivendell . We have come a long way with you and been through some stiff times . We want to go on . ’ 
 ‘ That ’s what I meant , ’ said Pippin . ‘ We hobbits ought to stick together , and we will . I shall go , unless hobbits chain me up . There must be someone with intelligence in the party . ’ 
 ‘ Then you certainly will not be chosen , Peregrin Took ! ’ said Gandalf , looking in through the window , which was near the ground . ‘ But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily . Nothing is decided yet . ’ 
 ‘ Nothing decided ! ’ cried Pippin . ‘ Then what were you all doing ? You were shut up for hours . ’ 
 ‘ Talking , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ There was a deal of talk , and everyone had an eye - opener . Even old Gandalf . I think Legolas ’s bit of news about Gollum caught even Legolas on the hop , though Legolas passed bit off . ’ 
 ‘ You were wrong , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ You were inattentive . I had already heard of bit from Gwaihir . If you want to know , the only real eye - openers , as you put bit , were you and Frodo ; and I was the only one that was not surprised . ’ 
 ‘ Well , anyway , ’ said Bilbo , ‘ nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam . I was afraid all the time that bit might come to that , if I was let off . But if you ask me , Elrond will send out a fair number , when the reports come in . Have reports started yet , Gandalf ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said the wizard . ‘ Some of the scouts have been sent out already . More will go tomorrow . Elrond is sending Elves , and Elves will get in touch with the Rangers , and maybe with Thranduil ’s folk in Mirkwood . And Aragorn has gone with Elrond ’s sons . We shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues before any move is made . So cheer up , Frodo ! You will probably make quite a long stay here . ’ 
 ‘ Ah ! ’ said Sam gloomily . ‘ We ’ll just wait long enough for winter to come . ’ 
 ‘ That ca n’t be helped , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ That ’s your fault partly , Frodo my lad : insisting on waiting for my birthday . A funny way of honouring That , I ca n’t help thinking . Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B.s into Bag End . But there it is : you ca n’t wait now till spring ; and you ca n’t go till the reports come back . 
 When winter first begins to bite 
 and stones crack in the frosty night , 
 when pools are black and trees are bare , 
 ’ tis evil in the Wild to fare . 
 But that I am afraid will be just your luck . ’ 
 ‘ I am afraid winter will , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ We ca n’t start until we have found out about the Riders . ’ 
 ‘ I thought Riders were all destroyed in the flood , ’ said Merry . 
 ‘ You can not destroy Ringwraiths like that , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ The power of Ringwraiths master is in Ringwraiths , and Ringwraiths stand or fall by master . We hope that Ringwraiths were all unhorsed and unmasked , and so made for a while less dangerous ; but we must find out for certain . In the meantime you should try and forget your troubles , Frodo . I do not know if I can do anything to help you ; but I will whisper this in your ears . Someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party . Someone was right . I think I shall come with you . ’ 
 So great was Frodo ’s delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window - sill , where Gandalf had been sitting , and took off Gandalf hat and bowed . ‘ I only said I think I shall come . Do not count on anything yet . In this matter Elrond will have much to say , and your friend the Strider . Which reminds me , I want to see Elrond . I must be off . ’ 
 ‘ How long do you think I shall have here ? ’ said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone . 
 ‘ Oh , I do n’t know . I ca n’t count days in Rivendell , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ But quite long , I should think . We can have many a good talk . What about helping me with my book , and making a start on the next ? Have you thought of an ending ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , several , and all are dark and unpleasant , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Oh , that wo n’t do ! ’ said Bilbo . ‘ Books ought to have good endings . How would this do : and Books all settled down and lived together happily ever after ? ’ 
 ‘ this will do well , if this ever comes to that , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Ah ! ’ said Sam . ‘ And where will Books live ? That ’s what I often wonder . ’ 
 For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils that lay ahead ; but such was the virtue of the land of Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from hobbits minds . The future , good or ill , was not forgotten , but ceased to have any power over the present . Health and hope grew strong in hobbits , and hobbits were content with each good day as Health came , taking pleasure in every meal , and in every word and song . 
 So the days slipped away , as each morning dawned bright and fair , and each evening followed cool and clear . But autumn was waning fast ; slowly the golden light faded to pale silver , and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees . A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the east . The Hunter ’s Moon waxed round in the night sky , and put to flight all the lesser stars . But low in the South one star shone red . Every night , as the Moon waned again , star shone brighter and brighter . Frodo could see star from Hunter window , deep in the heavens , burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley . 
 The hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of Elrond , and November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn , and December was passing , when the scouts began to return . Some had gone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors ; and others had gone west , and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood , as far as Tharbad , where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined town . Many had gone east and south ; and some of these had crossed the Mountains and entered Mirkwood , while others had climbed the pass at the sources of the Gladden River , and had come down into Wilderland and over the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel . Radagast was not there ; and others had returned over the high pass that was called the Redhorn Gate . The sons of Elrond , Elladan and Elrohir , were the last to return ; sons had made a great journey , passing down the Silverlode into a strange country , but of sons errand sons would not speak to any save to Elrond . 
 In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the Riders or other servants of the Enemy . Even from the Eagles of the Misty Mountains messengers had learned no fresh news . Nothing had been seen or heard of Gollum ; but the wild wolves were still gathering , and were hunting again far up the Great River . Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded Ford . On the rocks of the rapids below Three searchers discovered the bodies of five more , and also a long black cloak , slashed and tattered . Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen , and nowhere was Riders presence to be felt . It seemed that Riders had vanished from the North . 
 ‘ Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ It is rash to be too sure , yet I think that we may hope now that the Ringwraiths were scattered , and have been obliged to return as best Ringwraiths could to Ringwraiths Master in Mordor , empty and shapeless . 
 ‘ If that is so , it will be some time before Ringwraiths can begin the hunt again . Of course the Enemy has other servants , but servants will have to journey all the way to the borders of Rivendell before servants can pick up our trail . And if we are careful that will be hard to find . But we must delay no longer . ’ 
 Elrond summoned the hobbits to Rivendell . Elrond looked gravely at Frodo . ‘ The time has come , ’ Elrond said . ‘ If the Ring is to set out , Ring must go soon . But those who go with Ring must not count on those errand being aided by war or force . those must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid . Do you still hold to your word , Frodo , that you will be the Ring - bearer ? ’ 
 ‘ I do , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I will go with Sam . ’ 
 ‘ Then I can not help you much , not even with counsel , ’ said Elrond . ‘ I can foresee very little of your road ; and how your task is to be achieved I do not know . The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains , and draws nigh even to the borders of the Greyflood ; and under the Shadow all is dark to me . You will meet many foes , some open , and some disguised ; and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for some . I will send out messages , such as I can contrive , to those whom I know in the wide world ; but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry , or come no quicker than you yourself . 
 ‘ And I will choose you companions to go with you , as far as companions will or fortune allows . The number must be few , since your hope is in speed and secrecy . Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days , host would avail little , save to arouse the power of Mordor . 
 ‘ The Mordor of the Ring shall be Nine ; and the Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine Riders that are evil . With you and your faithful servant , Gandalf will go ; for this shall be Gandalf great task , and maybe the end of Gandalf labours . 
 ‘ For the rest , labours shall represent the other Free Peoples of the World : Elves , Dwarves , and Men . Legolas shall be for the Elves ; and Gimli son of Glóin for the Dwarves . labours are willing to go at least to the passes of the Mountains , and maybe beyond . For men you shall have Aragorn son of Arathorn , for the Ring of Isildur concerns Glóin closely . ’ 
 ‘ Strider ! ’ cried Frodo . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ Frodo said with a smile . ‘ I ask leave once again to be your companion , Frodo . ’ 
 ‘ I would have begged you to come , ’ said Frodo , ‘ only I thought you were going to Minas Tirith with Boromir . ’ 
 ‘ I am , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ And the Sword - that - was - Broken shall be re - forged ere I set out to war . But your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles . Therefore Boromir will also be in the Company . Boromir is a valiant man . ’ 
 ‘ There remain two more to be found , ’ said Elrond . ‘ These I will consider . Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send . ’ 
 ‘ But that will leave no place for us ! ’ cried Pippin in dismay . ‘ We do n’t want to be left behind . We want to go with Frodo . ’ 
 ‘ That is because you do not understand and can not imagine what lies ahead , ’ said Elrond . 
 ‘ Neither does Frodo , ’ said Gandalf , unexpectedly supporting Pippin . ‘ Nor do any of us see clearly . It is true that if these hobbits understood the danger , hobbits would not dare to go . But hobbits would still wish to go , or wish that hobbits dared , and be shamed and unhappy . I think , Elrond , that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to hobbits friendship than to great wisdom . Even if you chose for us an Elf - lord , such as Glorfindel , lord could not storm the Dark Tower , nor open the road to the Fire by the power that is in Fire . ’ 
 ‘ You speak gravely , ’ said Elrond , ‘ but I am in doubt . The 
 Shire , I forebode , is not free now from peril ; and these two I had thought to send back there as messengers , to do what messengers could , according to the fashion of messengers country , to warn the people of messengers danger . In any case , I judge that the younger of these two , Peregrin Took , should remain . My heart is against case going . ’ 
 ‘ Then , Master Elrond , you will have to lock me in prison , or send me home tied in a sack , ’ said Pippin . ‘ For otherwise I shall follow the Company . ’ 
 ‘ Let Company be so then . You shall go , ’ said Elrond , and Elrond sighed . ‘ Now the tale of Nine is filled . In seven days the Company must depart . ’ 
 The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths , and on Sword blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the rayed Sun , and about smiths was written many runes ; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor . Very bright was that sword when sword was made whole again ; the light of the sun shone redly in sword , and the light of the moon shone cold , and sword edge was hard and keen . And Aragorn gave sword a new name and called sword Andúril , Flame of the West . 
 Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of Aragorn road and the perils Aragorn would meet ; and Aragorn pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond . Sometimes Frodo was with Aragorn ; but Frodo was content to lean on Aragorn guidance , and Frodo spent as much time as Frodo could with Bilbo . 
 In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire , and there among many tales hobbits heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel ; but in the day , while Merry and Pippin were out and about , Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in Frodo own small room . Then Bilbo would read passages from Bilbo book ( which still seemed very incomplete ) , or scraps of Bilbo verses , or would take notes of Frodo ’s adventures . 
 On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo , and the old hobbit pulled out from under Frodo bed a wooden 
 box . Frodo lifted the lid and fumbled inside . 
 ‘ Here is your sword , ’ Frodo said . ‘ But sword was broken , you know . I took sword to keep sword safe but I ’ve forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend sword . No time now . So I thought , perhaps , you would care to have this , do n’t you know ? ’ 
 Frodo took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard . Then Frodo drew sword , and sword polished and well - tended blade glittered suddenly , cold and bright . ‘ This is Sting , ’ Frodo said , and thrust sword with little effort deep into a wooden beam . ‘ Take This , if you like . I sha n’t want This again , I expect . ’ 
 Frodo accepted sword gratefully . 
 ‘ Also there is this ! ’ said Bilbo , bringing out a parcel which seemed to be rather heavy for parcel size . Bilbo unwound several folds of old cloth , and held up a small shirt of mail . shirt was close - woven of many rings , as supple almost as linen , cold as ice , and harder than steel . shirt shone like moonlit silver , and was studded with white gems . With shirt was a belt of pearl and crystal . 
 ‘ this ’s a pretty thing , is n’t it ? ’ said Bilbo , moving shirt in the light . ‘ And useful . It is my dwarf - mail that Thorin gave me . I got mail back from Michel Delving before I started , and packed mail with my luggage . I brought all the mementoes of my Journey away with me , except the Ring . But I did not expect to use this , and I do n’t need this now , except to look at sometimes . You hardly feel any weight when you put this on . ’ 
 ‘ I should look – well , I do n’t think I should look right in this , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Just what I said myself , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ But never mind about looks . You can wear this under your outer clothes . Come on ! You must share this secret with me . Do n’t tell anybody else ! But I should feel happier if I knew you were wearing secret . I have a fancy secret would turn even the knives of the Black Riders , ’ he ended in a low voice . 
 ‘ Very well , I will take secret , ’ said Frodo . Bilbo put voice on he , and fastened Sting upon the glittering belt ; and then Frodo put over the top Frodo old weather - stained breeches , tunic , and jacket . 
 ‘ Just a plain hobbit you look , ’ said Bilbo . ‘ But there is more about you now than appears on the surface . Good luck to you ! ’ Bilbo turned away and looked out of the window , trying to hum a tune . 
 ‘ I can not thank you as I should , Bilbo , for this , and for all your past kindnesses , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Do n’t try ! ’ said the old hobbit , turning round and slapping Frodo on the back . ‘ Ow ! ’ Frodo cried . ‘ You are too hard now to slap ! But there you are : Hobbits must stick together , and especially Bagginses . All I ask in return is : take as much care of yourself as you can , and bring back all the news you can , and any old songs and tales you can come by . I ’ll do my best to finish my book before you return . I should like to write the second book , if I am spared . ’ He broke off and turned to the window again , singing softly . 
 I sit beside the fire and think 
 of all that I have seen , 
 of meadow - flowers and butterflies 
 in summers that have been ; 
 Of yellow leaves and gossamer 
 in autumns that there were , 
 with morning mist and silver sun 
 and wind upon my hair . 
 I sit beside the fire and think 
 of how the world will be 
 when winter comes without a spring 
 that I shall ever see . 
 For still there are so many things 
 that I have never seen : 
 in every wood in every spring 
 there is a different green . 
 I sit beside the fire and think 
 of people long ago , 
 and people who will see a world 
 that I shall never know . 
 But all the while I sit and think 
 of times there were before , 
 I listen for returning feet 
 and voices at the door . 
 door was a cold grey day near the end of December . The East Wind was streaming through the bare branches of the trees , and seething in the dark pines on the hills . Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead , dark and low . As the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company made ready to set out . shadows were to start at dusk , for Elrond counselled shadows to journey under cover of night as often as shadows could , until shadows were far from Rivendell . 
 ‘ You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron , ’ Elrond said . ‘ I do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached Sauron , and Sauron will be filled with wrath . Soon now Sauron spies on foot and wing will be abroad in the northern lands . Even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way . ’ 
 The Company took little gear of war , for shadows hope was in secrecy not in battle . Aragorn had Andúril but no other weapon , and Aragorn went forth clad only in rusty green and brown , as a Ranger of the wilderness . Boromir had a long sword , in fashion like Andúril but of less lineage , and Aragorn bore also a shield and Aragorn war - horn . 
 ‘ Loud and clear way sounds in the valleys of the hills , ’ Aragorn said , ‘ and then let all the foes of Gondor flee ! ’ Putting blast to Aragorn lips Aragorn blew a blast , and the echoes leapt from rock to rock , and all that heard that voice in Rivendell sprang to echoes feet . 
 ‘ Slow should you be to wind that horn again , Boromir , ’ said Elrond , ‘ until you stand once more on the borders of your land , and dire need is on you . ’ 
 ‘ Maybe , ’ said Boromir . ‘ But always I have let my horn cry at setting forth , and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows , I will not go forth as a thief in the night . ’ 
 Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel - rings , for dwarves make light of burdens ; and in Boromir belt was a broad - bladed axe . Legolas had a bow and a quiver , and at Boromir belt a long white knife . The younger hobbits wore the swords that hobbits had taken from the barrow ; but Frodo took only Sting ; and Frodo mail - coat , as Bilbo wished , remained hidden . Gandalf bore Gandalf staff , but girt at Gandalf side was the elven - sword Glamdring , the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain . 
 All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes , and clothes had jackets and cloaks lined with fur . Spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony , none other than the poor beast that clothes had brought from Bree . 
 The stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on pony : pony was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth . It was Sam who had insisted on choosing Sam , declaring that Bill ( as Sam called Bill ) would pine , if Bill did not come . 
 ‘ That animal can nearly talk , ’ Bill said , ‘ and would talk , if Bill stayed here much longer . Bill gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak look : if you do n’t let me go with you , Sam , I ’ll follow on my own . ’ So Bill was going as the beast of burden , yet Sam was the only member of the Company that did not seem depressed . 
 member farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire , and member were only waiting now for Gandalf , who had not yet come out of the house . A gleam of firelight came from the open doors , and soft lights were glowing in many windows . Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside Frodo . Aragorn sat with Bilbo head bowed to Bilbo knees ; only Elrond knew fully what this hour meant to Bilbo . 
 The others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness . 
 Sam was standing by the pony , sucking Sam teeth , and staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily below ; Sam desire for adventure was at river lowest ebb . 
 ‘ Bill , my lad , ’ Sam said , ‘ you ought n’t to have took up with us . You could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes . ’ Bill swished Sam tail and said nothing . 
 Sam eased the pack on Sam shoulders , and went over anxiously in Sam mind all the things that Sam had stowed in pack , wondering if Sam had forgotten anything : Sam chief treasure , Sam cooking gear ; and the little box of salt that Sam always carried and refilled when Sam could ; a good supply of pipe - weed ( but not near enough , I ’ll warrant ) ; flint and tinder ; woollen hose ; linen ; various small belongings of Sam master ’s that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring master out in triumph when master were called for . Sam went through master all . 
 ‘ Rope ! ’ Sam muttered . ‘ No rope ! And only last night you said to yourself : “ Sam , what about a bit of rope ? You ’ll want rope , if you have n’t got rope . ” Well , I ’ll want rope . I ca n’t get rope now . ’ 
 At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf , and Elrond called the Company to Gandalf . ‘ This is my last word , ’ Gandalf said in a low voice . ‘ The Ring - bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom . On bearer alone is any charge laid : neither to cast away the Ring , nor to deliver Ring to any servant of the Enemy nor indeed to let any handle Ring , save members of the Company and the Council , and only then in gravest need . The others go with bearer as free companions , to help bearer on bearer way . You may tarry , or come back , or turn aside into other paths , as chance allows . The further you go , the less easy will it be to withdraw ; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you will . For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts , and you can not foresee what each may meet upon the road . ’ 
 ‘ Faithless is bearer that says farewell when the road darkens , ’ said Gimli . 
 ‘ Maybe , ’ said Elrond , ‘ but let bearer not vow to walk in the dark , who has not seen the nightfall . ’ 
 ‘ Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart , ’ said Gimli . 
 ‘ Or break word , ’ said Elrond . ‘ Look not too far ahead ! But go now with good hearts ! Farewell , and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you . May the stars shine upon your faces ! ’ 
 ‘ Good ... good luck ! ’ cried Bilbo , stuttering with the cold . ‘ I do n’t suppose you will be able to keep a diary , Frodo my lad , but I shall expect a full account when you get back . And do n’t be too long ! Farewell ! ’ 
 Many others of Elrond ’s household stood in the shadows and watched others go , bidding shadows farewell with soft voices . There was no laughter , and no song or music . At last others turned away and faded silently into the dusk . 
 others crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell ; and others came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather . Then with one glance at the Last Homely House twinkling below others others strode away far into the night . 
 At the Ford of Bruinen others left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands . others purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many miles and days . The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range , and others going would be slow ; but others hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes . The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country , and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell . 
 Gandalf walked in front , and with Sauron went Aragorn , who knew this land even in the dark . The others were in file behind , and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard . 
 The first part of others journey was hard and dreary , and Frodo remembered little of part , save the wind . For many sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east , and no garment seemed able to keep out garment searching fingers . Though the Company was well clad , Mountains seldom felt warm , either moving or at rest . Mountains slept uneasily during the middle of the day , in some hollow of the land , or hidden under the tangled thorn - bushes that grew in thickets in many places . In the late afternoon Mountains were roused by the watch , and took Mountains chief meal : cold and cheerless as a rule , for Mountains could seldom risk the lighting of a fire . In the evening Mountains went on again , always as nearly southward as Mountains could find a way . 
 At first it seemed to the hobbits that although hobbits walked and stumbled until hobbits were weary , hobbits were creeping forward like snails , and getting nowhere . Each day the land looked much the same as land had the day before . Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer . South of Rivendell mountains rose ever higher , and bent westwards ; and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills , and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters . Paths were few and winding , and led mountains often only to the edge of some sheer fall , or down into treacherous swamps . 
 mountains had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed . The wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south . The swift - flowing clouds lifted and melted away , and the sun came out , pale and bright . There came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night - march . The travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly - trees whose grey - green trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills . trunks dark leaves shone and trunks berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun . 
 Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking . At the left of this high range rose three peaks ; the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow ; tooth great , bare , northern precipice was still largely in the shadow , but where the sunlight slanted upon tooth , tooth glowed red . 
 Gandalf stood at Frodo ’s side and looked out under Gandalf hand . ‘ We have done well , ’ hand said . ‘ We have reached the borders of the country that Men call Hollin ; many Elves lived here in happier days , when Eregion was Eregion name . Five - and - forty leagues as the crow flies we have come , though many long miles further our feet have walked . The land and the weather will be milder now , but perhaps all the more dangerous . ’ 
 ‘ Dangerous or not , a real sunrise is mighty welcome , ’ said Frodo , throwing back Frodo hood and letting the morning light fall on Frodo face . 
 ‘ But the mountains are ahead of us , ’ said Pippin . ‘ We must have turned eastwards in the night . ’ 
 ‘ No , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But you see further ahead in the clear light . Beyond those peaks the range bends round south - west . There are many maps in Elrond ’s house , but I suppose you never thought to look at maps ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes I did , sometimes , ’ said Pippin , ‘ but I do n’t remember maps . Frodo has a better head for that sort of thing . ’ 
 ‘ I need no map , ’ said Gimli , who had come up with Legolas , and was gazing out before Pippin with a strange light in Gimli deep eyes . ‘ There is the land where our fathers worked of old , and we have wrought the image of those mountains into many works of metal and of stone , and into many songs and tales . fathers stand tall in our dreams : Baraz , Zirak , Shathûr . 
 ‘ Only once before have I seen fathers from afar in waking life , but I know fathers and fathers names , for under fathers lies Khazad - dûm , the Dwarrowdelf , that is now called the Black Pit , Moria in the Elvish tongue . Yonder stands Barazinbar , the Redhorn , cruel Caradhras ; and beyond Redhorn are Silvertine and Cloudyhead : Celebdil the White , and Fanuidhol the Grey , that we call Zirakzigil and Bundushathûr . 
 ‘ There the Misty Mountains divide , and between Mountains arms lies the deep - shadowed valley which we can not forget : Azanulbizar , the Dimrill Dale , which the Elves call Nanduhirion . ’ 
 ‘ It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ If we climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate , under the far side of Caradhras , we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the Dwarves . There lies the Mirrormere , and there the River Silverlode rises in Silverlode icy springs . ’ 
 ‘ Dark is the water of Kheled - zâram , ’ said Gimli , ‘ and cold are the springs of Kibil - nâla . My heart trembles at the thought that I may see springs soon . ’ 
 ‘ May you have joy of the sight , my good dwarf ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But whatever you may do , we at least can not stay in that valley . We must go down the Silverlode into the secret woods , and so to the Great River , and then — — ’ 
 Gandalf paused . 
 ‘ Yes , and where then ? ’ asked Merry . ‘ To the end of the journey – in the end , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ We can not look too far ahead . Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over . I think we will rest here , not only today but tonight as well . There is a wholesome air about Hollin . Much evil must befall a country before evil wholly forgets the Elves , if once Elves dwelt there . ’ 
 ‘ That is true , ’ said Legolas . ‘ But the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk , and the trees and the grass do not now remember Elves . Only I hear the stones lament Elves : deep Elves delved us , fair Elves wrought us , high Elves builded us ; but Elves are gone . Elves are gone . Elves sought the Havens long ago . ’ 
 That morning Elves lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly , and Elves supper - breakfast was merrier than it had been since Elves set out . Elves did not hurry to bed afterwards , for Elves expected to have all the night to sleep in , and Elves did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day . Only Aragorn was silent and restless . 
 After a while Aragorn left the Company and wandered on to the ridge ; there Aragorn stood in the shadow of a tree , looking out southwards and westwards , with Aragorn head posed as if Aragorn was listening . Then Aragorn returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talking . 
 ‘ What is the matter , Strider ? ’ Merry called up . ‘ What are you looking for ? Do you miss the East Wind ? ’ 
 ‘ No indeed , ’ Aragorn answered . ‘ But I miss something . I have been in the country of Hollin in many seasons . No folk dwell here now , but many other creatures live here at all times , especially birds . Yet now all things but you are silent . I can feel folk . There is no sound for miles about us , and your voices seem to make the ground echo . I do not understand ground . ’ 
 Gandalf looked up with sudden interest . ‘ But what do you guess is the reason ? ’ Gandalf asked . ‘ Is there more in ground than surprise at seeing four hobbits , not to mention the rest of us , where people are so seldom seen or heard ? ’ 
 ‘ I hope that is ground , ’ answered Aragorn . ‘ But I have a sense of watchfulness , and of fear , that I have never had here before . ’ 
 ‘ Then we must be more careful , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ If you bring a Ranger with you , it is well to pay attention to Ranger , especially if the Ranger is Aragorn . We must stop talking aloud , rest quietly , and set the watch . ’ 
 It was Sam ’s turn that day to take the first watch , but Aragorn joined Sam . The others fell asleep . Then the silence grew until even Sam felt silence . The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard . The swish of the pony ’s tail and the occasional movements of pony feet became loud noises . Sam could hear Sam own joints creaking , if Sam stirred . Dead silence was around Sam , and over all hung a clear blue sky , as the Sun rode up from the East . Away in the South a dark patch appeared , and grew , and drove north like flying smoke in the wind . 
 ‘ What ’s that , Strider ? South do n’t look like a cloud , ’ said Sam in a whisper to Aragorn . Sam made no answer , Sam was gazing intently at the sky ; but before long Sam could see for Sam what was approaching . Flocks of birds , flying at great speed , were wheeling and circling , and traversing all the land as if Flocks were searching for something ; and Flocks were steadily drawing nearer . 
 ‘ Lie flat and still ! ’ hissed Aragorn , pulling Sam down into the shade of a holly - bush ; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host , and came , flying low , straight towards the ridge . Sam thought birds were a kind of crow of large size . As birds passed overhead , in so dense a throng that birds shadow followed birds darkly over the ground below , one harsh croak was heard . 
 Not until birds had dwindled into the distance , north and west , and the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise . Then Sam sprang up and went and wakened Gandalf . 
 ‘ Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the Mountains and the Greyflood , ’ Sam said , ‘ and Regiments have passed over Hollin . Regiments are not natives here ; Regiments are crebain out of Fangorn and Dunland . I do not know what Regiments are about : possibly there is some trouble away south from which Regiments are fleeing ; but I think Regiments are spying out the land . I have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky . I think we ought to move again this evening . Hollin is no longer wholesome for us : it is being watched . ’ 
 ‘ And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate , ’ said Gandalf ; ‘ and how we can get over that without being seen , I can not imagine . But we will think of that when we must . As for moving as soon as that is dark , I am afraid that you are right . ’ 
 ‘ Luckily our fire made little smoke , and had burned low before the crebain came , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ crebain must be put out and not lit again . ’ 
 ‘ Well if that is n’t a plague and a nuisance ! ’ said Pippin . The news : no fire , and a move again by night , had been broken to Pippin , as soon as Pippin woke in the late afternoon . ‘ All because of a pack of crows ! I had looked forward to a real good meal tonight : something hot . ’ 
 ‘ Well , you can go on looking forward , ’ said Gandalf . 
 ‘ There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you . For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort , and warmer feet . However , we are certain of one thing at any rate : pipe will get warmer as we get south . ’ 
 ‘ Too warm , I should n’t wonder , ’ muttered Sam to Frodo . ‘ But I ’m beginning to think pipe ’s time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain , and saw the end of the Road , so to speak . I thought at first that this here Redhorn , or whatever this name is , might be it , till Gimli spoke Gimli piece . A fair jaw - cracker dwarf - language must be ! ’ Maps conveyed nothing to Sam ’s mind , and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that Sam was quite out of Sam reckoning . 
 All that day the Company remained in hiding . The dark birds passed over now and again ; but as the westering Sun grew red birds disappeared southwards . At dusk the Sun set out , and turning now half east birds steered birds course towards Caradhras , which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished Sun . One by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded . 
 Guided by Aragorn stars struck a good path . One looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient road , that had once been broad and well planned , from Hollin to the mountain - pass . The Moon , now at the full , rose over the mountains , and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black . Many of mountains looked to have been worked by hands , though now mountains lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak , barren land . 
 land was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn , and the moon was low . Frodo looked up at the sky . Suddenly Frodo saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars , as if for a moment stars faded and then flashed out again . Frodo shivered . 
 ‘ Did you see anything pass over ? ’ Frodo whispered to Gandalf , who was just ahead . 
 ‘ No , but I felt No , whatever No was , ’ Frodo answered . ‘ No may be nothing , only a wisp of thin cloud . ’ 
 ‘ No was moving fast then , ’ muttered Aragorn , ‘ and not with the wind . ’ 
 Nothing further happened that night . The next morning dawned even brighter than before . But the air was chill again ; already the wind was turning back towards the east . For two more nights Aragorn marched on , climbing steadily but ever more slowly as nights road wound up into the hills , and the mountains towered up , nearer and nearer . On the third morning Caradhras rose before nights , a mighty peak , tipped with snow like silver , but with sheer naked sides , dull red as if stained with blood . 
 There was a black look in the sky , and the sun was wan . The wind had gone now round to the north - east . Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back . 
 ‘ Winter deepens behind us , ’ Caradhras said quietly to Aragorn . ‘ The heights away north are whiter than heights were ; snow is lying far down heights shoulders . Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate . We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path , and waylaid by some evil ; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any . What do you think of your course now , Aragorn ? ’ 
 Frodo overheard these words , and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before . Gandalf listened anxiously . 
 ‘ I think no good of our course from beginning to end , as you know well , Gandalf , ’ answered Aragorn . ‘ And perils known and unknown will grow as we go on . But we must go on ; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the mountains . Further south there are no passes , till one comes to the Gap of Rohan . I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman . Who knows which side now the marshals of the Horse - lords serve ? ’ 
 ‘ Who knows indeed ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But there is another way , and not by the pass of Caradhras : the dark and secret way that we have spoken of . ’ 
 ‘ But let us not speak of pass again ! Not yet . Say nothing to the others , I beg , not until it is plain that there is no other way . ’ 
 ‘ We must decide before we go further , ’ answered Gandalf . 
 ‘ Then let us weigh the matter in our minds , while the others rest and sleep , ’ said Aragorn . 
 In the late afternoon , while the others were finishing others breakfast , Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras . Caradhras sides were now dark and sullen , and Caradhras head was in grey cloud . Frodo watched sides , wondering which way the debate would go . When sides returned to the Company Gandalf spoke , and then Frodo knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass . Frodo was relieved . Frodo could not guess what was the other dark and secret way , but the very mention of way had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay , and Frodo was glad that way had been abandoned . 
 ‘ From signs that we have seen lately , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched ; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind . Snow may come . We must go with all the speed that we can . Even so Snow will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the pass . Dark will come early this evening . We must leave as soon as you can get ready . ’ 
 ‘ I will add a word of advice , if I may , ’ said Boromir . ‘ I was born under the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of journeys in the high Mountains . We shall meet bitter cold , if no worse , before we come down on the other side . cold will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to death . When we leave here , where there are still a few trees and bushes , each of us should carry a faggot of wood , as large as Bill can bear . ’ 
 ‘ And Bill could take a bit more , could n’t you , lad ? ’ said Sam . The pony looked at Sam mournfully . 
 ‘ Very well , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But we must not use the wood – not unless wood is a choice between fire and death . ’ 
 The Company set out again , with good speed at first ; but soon Company way became steep and difficult . The twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared , and was blocked with many fallen stones . The night grew deadly dark under great clouds . A bitter wind swirled among the rocks . By midnight rocks had climbed to the knees of the great mountains . The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left , above which the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom ; on the right was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine . 
 Laboriously rocks climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top . Frodo felt a soft touch on Frodo face . Frodo put out Frodo arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on Frodo sleeve . 
 flakes went on . But before long the snow was falling fast , filling all the air , and swirling into Frodo ’s eyes . The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen . 
 ‘ I do n’t like this at all , ’ panted Sam just behind . ‘ Snow ’s all right on a fine morning , but I like to be in bed while Snow ’s falling . I wish this lot would go off to Hobbiton ! Folk might welcome Hobbiton there . ’ Except on the high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire , and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun . No living hobbit ( save Bilbo ) could remember the Fell Winter of 1311 , when white wolves invaded the Shire over the frozen Brandywine . 
 Gandalf halted . Snow was thick on Bilbo hood and shoulders ; it was already ankle - deep about Bilbo boots . 
 ‘ This is what I feared , ’ Bilbo said . ‘ What do you say now , Aragorn ? ’ 
 ‘ That I feared This too , ’ Aragorn answered , ‘ but less than other things . I knew the risk of snow , though risk seldom falls heavily so far south , save high up in the mountains . But we are not high yet ; we are still far down , where the paths are usually open all the winter . ’ 
 ‘ I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy , ’ said Boromir . ‘ paths say in my land that Boromir can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor . Boromir has strange powers and many allies . ’ 
 ‘ Boromir arm has grown long indeed , ’ said Gimli , ‘ if Boromir can draw snow down from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away . ’ 
 ‘ Boromir arm has grown long , ’ said Gandalf . 
 While Gandalf were halted , the wind died down , and the snow slackened until wind almost ceased . Gimli tramped on again . But North had not gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury . The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard . Soon even Boromir found wind hard to keep going . The hobbits , bent nearly double , toiled along behind the taller folk , but it was plain that hobbits could not go much further , if the snow continued . Frodo ’s feet felt like lead . Pippin was dragging behind . Even Gimli , as stout as any dwarf could be , was grumbling as Gimli trudged . 
 The Company halted suddenly , as if dwarf had come to an agreement without any words being spoken . dwarf heard eerie noises in the darkness round dwarf . Company may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall , but the sounds were those of shrill cries , and wild howls of laughter . Stones began to fall from the mountain - side , whistling over Stones heads , or crashing on the path beside heads . Every now and again heads heard a dull rumble , as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above . 
 ‘ We can not go further tonight , ’ said Boromir . ‘ Let those call boulder the wind who will ; there are fell voices on the air ; and these stones are aimed at us . ’ 
 ‘ I do call boulder the wind , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But that does not make what you say untrue . There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs , and yet are not in league with Sauron , but have purposes of purposes own . Some have been in this world longer than Sauron . ’ 
 ‘ Caradhras was called the Cruel , and had an ill name , ’ said Gimli , ‘ long years ago , when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands . ’ 
 ‘ rumour matters little who is the enemy , if we can not beat off Sauron attack , ’ said Gandalf . 
 ‘ But what can we do ? ’ cried Pippin miserably . Pippin was leaning on Merry and Frodo , and Pippin was shivering . 
 ‘ Either stop where we are , or go back , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ It is no good going on . Only a little higher , if I remember rightly , this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope . We should have no shelter there from snow , or stones – or anything else . ’ 
 ‘ And it is no good going back while the storm holds , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ We have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff - wall we are under now . ’ 
 ‘ Shelter ! ’ muttered Sam . ‘ If this is shelter , then one wall and no roof make a house . ’ 
 The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as Company could . cliff faced southwards , and near the bottom cliff leaned out a little , so that wall hoped cliff would give wall some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones . But eddying blasts swirled round wall from every side , and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds . 
 wall huddled together with wall backs to the wall . Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits , and screened wall a little ; but before long the drifting snow was above pony hocks , and snow went on mounting . If wall had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried . 
 A great sleepiness came over Frodo ; Frodo felt Frodo sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream . Frodo thought a fire was heating Frodo toes , and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth Frodo heard Bilbo ’s voice speaking . I do n’t think much of your diary , Frodo said . Snowstorms on January the twelfth : there was no need to come back to report that ! 
 But I wanted rest and sleep , Bilbo , Frodo answered with an effort , when January felt January shaken , and January came back painfully to wakefulness . Boromir had lifted January off the ground out of a nest of snow . 
 ‘ This will be the death of the halflings , Gandalf , ’ said Boromir . ‘ It is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads . We must do something to save ourselves . ’ 
 ‘ Give heads this , ’ said Gandalf , searching in Gandalf pack and drawing out a leathern flask . ‘ Just a mouthful each – for all of us . each is very precious . each is miruvor , the cordial of Imladris . Elrond gave each to me at our parting . Pass each round ! ’ 
 As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor Frodo felt a new strength of heart , and the heavy drowsiness left Frodo limbs . The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour . But the snow did not relent . snow whirled about others thicker than ever , and the wind blew louder . 
 ‘ What do you say to fire ? ’ asked Boromir suddenly . ‘ The choice seems near now between fire and death , Gandalf . Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us , but that will not help us . ’ 
 ‘ You may make a fire , if you can , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ If there are any watchers that can endure this storm , then watchers can see us , fire or no . ’ 
 But though Elf had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir , wood passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel . At last reluctantly Gandalf Gandalf took a hand . Picking up a faggot Gandalf held faggot aloft for a moment , and then with a word of command , naur an edraith ammen ! Gandalf thrust the end of Gandalf staff into the midst of end . At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out , and the wood flared and sputtered . 
 ‘ If there are any to see , then I at least am revealed to any , ’ Gandalf said . ‘ I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin . ’ 
 But the Rivendell cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes . watchers hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire . The wood burned merrily ; and though all round wood the snow hissed , and pools of slush crept under pools feet , pools warmed pools hands gladly at the blaze . There pools stood , stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames . A red light was on pools tired and anxious faces ; behind pools the night was like a black wall . 
 But the wood was burning fast , and the snow still fell . 
 The fire burned low , and the last faggot was thrown on . 
 ‘ The night is getting old , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ The dawn is not far off . ’ 
 ‘ If any dawn can pierce these clouds , ’ said Gimli . Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness . ‘ The snow is growing less , ’ Gimli said , ‘ and the wind is quieter . ’ 
 Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire ; but for a long time Gimli could see no sign of flakes slackening . Then suddenly , as sleep was beginning to creep over Gimli again , Gimli was aware that the wind had indeed fallen , and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer . Very slowly a dim light began to grow . At last the snow stopped altogether . 
 As the light grew stronger snow showed a silent shrouded world . Below light refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that light had trodden was altogether lost ; but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow . 
 Gimli looked up and shook world head . ‘ Caradhras has not forgiven us , ’ world said . ‘ Caradhras has more snow yet to fling at us , if we go on . The sooner we go back and down the better . ’ 
 To this all agreed , but all retreat was now difficult . retreat might well prove impossible . Only a few paces from the ashes of paces fire the snow lay many feet deep , higher than the heads of the hobbits ; in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff . 
 ‘ If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame , Gandalf might melt a path for you , ’ said Legolas . The storm had troubled Gandalf little , and Gandalf alone of the Company remained still light of heart . 
 ‘ If Elves could fly over mountains , Elves might fetch the Sun to save us , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ But I must have something to work on . I can not burn snow . ’ 
 ‘ Well , ’ said Boromir , ‘ when heads are at a loss bodies must serve , as we say in my country . The strongest of us must seek a way . See ! Though all is now snow - clad , our path , as we came up , turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder . It was there that the snow first began to burden us . If we could reach that point , maybe point would prove easier beyond . point is no more than a furlong off , I guess . ’ 
 ‘ Then let us force a path thither , you and I ! ’ said Aragorn . 
 Aragorn was the tallest of the Company , but Boromir , little less in height , was broader and heavier in build . Boromir led the way , and Aragorn followed Boromir . Slowly Company moved off , and were soon toiling heavily . In places the snow was breast - high , and often Boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with Boromir great arms rather than walking . 
 Legolas watched places for a while with a smile upon Boromir lips , and then Boromir turned to the others . ‘ The strongest must seek a way , say you ? But I say : let a ploughman plough , but choose an otter for swimming , and for running light over grass and leaf , or over snow – an Elf . ’ 
 With that Boromir sprang forth nimbly , and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time , though Boromir had long known Elf , that the Elf had no boots , but wore only light shoes , as Boromir always did , and Boromir feet made little imprint in the snow . 
 ‘ Farewell ! ’ Boromir said to Gandalf . ‘ I go to find the Sun ! ’ Then swift as a runner over firm sand Boromir shot away , and quickly overtaking the toiling Boromir , with a wave of runner hand runner passed hand , and sped into the distance , and vanished round the rocky turn . 
 The others waited huddled together , watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness . At length others too passed from sight . The time dragged on . The clouds lowered , and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again . 
 An hour , maybe , went by , though it seemed far longer , and then at last others saw Legolas coming back . At the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind Legolas and came labouring up the slope . 
 ‘ Well , ’ cried Legolas as Boromir ran up , ‘ I have not brought the Sun . Sun is walking in the blue fields of the South , and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles Sun not at all . But I have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet . There is the greatest wind - drift of all just beyond the turn , and there our Strong Men were almost buried . Men despaired , until I returned and told Men that the drift was little wider than a wall . And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less , while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit ’s toes . ’ 
 ‘ Ah , it is as I said , ’ growled Gimli . ‘ hobbit was no ordinary storm . hobbit is the ill will of Caradhras . Caradhras does not love Elves and Dwarves , and that drift was laid to cut off our escape . ’ 
 ‘ But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you , ’ said Boromir , who came up at that moment . ‘ And doughty Men too , if I may say Men ; though lesser men with spades might have served you better . Still , we have thrust a lane through the drift ; and for that all here may be grateful who can not run as light as Elves . ’ 
 ‘ But how are we to get down there , even if you have cut through the drift ? ’ said Pippin , voicing the thought of all the hobbits . 
 ‘ Have hope ! ’ said Boromir . ‘ I am weary , but I still have some strength left , and Aragorn too . We will bear the little folk . The others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us . Come , Master Peregrin ! I will begin with you . ’ 
 Boromir lifted up the hobbit . ‘ Cling to my back ! I shall need my arms , ’ Boromir said and strode forward . Aragorn with Merry came behind . Pippin marvelled at Pippin strength , seeing the passage that Pippin had already forced with no other tool than Pippin great limbs . Even now , burdened as Pippin was , Pippin was widening the track for those who followed , thrusting the snow aside as Pippin went . 
 those came at length to the great drift . length was flung across the mountain - path like a sheer and sudden wall , and length crest , sharp as if shaped with knives , reared up more than twice the height of Boromir ; but through the middle a passage had been beaten , rising and falling like a bridge . On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down , and there Merry waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive . 
 After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam . Behind in the narrow but now well - trodden track came Gandalf , leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage . Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo . Merry passed through the lane ; but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow . The spray of rumble half blinded the Company as Merry crouched against the cliff , and when the air cleared again Merry saw that the path was blocked behind Merry . 
 ‘ Enough , enough ! ’ cried Gimli . ‘ We are departing as quickly as we may ! ’ And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended , as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return . The threat of snow lifted ; the clouds began to break and the light grew broader . 
 As Legolas had reported , clouds found that the snow became steadily more shallow as clouds went down , so that even the hobbits could trudge along . Soon clouds all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where clouds had felt the first flakes of snow the night before . 
 The morning was now far advanced . From the high place clouds looked back westwards over the lower lands . Far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which clouds had started to climb the pass . 
 Frodo ’s legs ached . head was chilled to the bone and hungry ; and head head was dizzy as head thought of the long and painful march downhill . Black specks swam before head eyes . head rubbed specks , but the black specks remained . In the distance below head , but still high above the lower foothills , dark dots were circling in the air . 
 ‘ The birds again ! ’ said Aragorn , pointing down . 
 ‘ That can not be helped now , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Whether birds are good or evil , or have nothing to do with us at all , we must go down at once . Not even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night - fall ! ’ 
 A cold wind flowed down behind dots , as dots turned dots backs on the Redhorn Gate , and stumbled wearily down the slope . Caradhras had defeated dots . 
 Chapter 4 
 A JOURNEY IN THE DARK 
 Chapter was evening , and the grey light was again waning fast , when dots halted for the night . dots were very weary . The mountains were veiled in deepening dusk , and the wind was cold . Gandalf spared dots one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell . When dots had eaten some food Gandalf called a council . 
 ‘ We can not , of course , go on again tonight , ’ Rivendell said . ‘ The attack on the Redhorn Gate has tired us out , and we must rest here for a while . ’ 
 ‘ And then where are we to go ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ We still have our journey and our errand before us , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ We have no choice but to go on , or to return to Rivendell . ’ 
 Pippin ’s face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell ; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully . But Aragorn and Boromir made no sign . Frodo looked troubled . 
 ‘ I wish I was back there , ’ Aragorn said . ‘ But how can I return without shame – unless there is indeed no other way , and we are already defeated ? ’ 
 ‘ You are right , Frodo , ’ said Gandalf : ‘ to go back is to admit defeat , and face worse defeat to come . If we go back now , then the Ring must remain there : we shall not be able to set out again . Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged , and after a brief and bitter time Rivendell will be destroyed . The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies , but Ringwraiths are only shadows yet of the power and terror Ringwraiths would possess if the Ruling Ring was on Ringwraiths master ’s hand again . ’ 
 ‘ Then we must go on , if there is a way , ’ said Frodo with a sigh . Sam sank back into gloom . 
 ‘ There is a way that we may attempt , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ I thought from the beginning , when first I considered this journey , that we should try journey . But journey is not a pleasant way , and I have not spoken of journey to the Company before . Aragorn was against journey , until the pass over the mountains had at least been tried . ’ 
 ‘ If journey is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate , then it must be evil indeed , ’ said Merry . ‘ But you had better tell us about journey , and let us know the worst at once . ’ 
 ‘ The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria , ’ said Gandalf . Only Gimli lifted up Gimli head ; a smouldering fire was in Gimli eyes . On all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name . Even to the hobbits dread was a legend of vague fear . 
 ‘ The road may lead to Moria , but how can we hope that road will lead through Moria ? ’ said Aragorn darkly . 
 ‘ road is a name of ill omen , ’ said Boromir . ‘ Nor do I see the need to go there . If we can not cross the mountains , let us journey southwards , until we come to the Gap of Rohan , where men are friendly to my people , taking the road that I followed on my way hither . Or we might pass by and cross the Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin , and so come to Gondor from the regions nigh to the sea . ’ 
 ‘ Things have changed since you came north , Boromir , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman ? With Saruman I may have business of my own ere all is over . But the Ring must not come near Isengard , if that can by any means be prevented . The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go with the Bearer . 
 ‘ As for the longer road : we can not afford the time . We might spend a year in such a journey , and we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless . Yet lands would not be safe . The watchful eyes both of Saruman and of the Enemy are on lands . When you came north , Boromir , you were in the Enemy ’s eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of small concern to Rohan : Rohan mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring . But you return now as a member of the Ring ’s Company , and you are in peril as long as you remain with us . The danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked sky . 
 ‘ Since our open attempt on the mountain - pass our plight has become more desperate , I fear . I see now little hope , if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while , and cover our trail . Therefore I advise that we should go neither over the mountains , nor round mountains , but under mountains . That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take . ’ 
 ‘ We do not know what Enemy expects , ’ said Boromir . ‘ Boromir may watch all roads , likely and unlikely . In that case to enter Moria would be to walk into a trap , hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower Tower . The name of Moria is black . ’ 
 ‘ You speak of what you do not know , when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ I alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the Dark Lord , and only in Boromir older and lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur . Those who pass the gates of Barad - dûr do not return . But I would not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again . If there are Orcs there , Orcs may prove ill for us , that is true . But most of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five Armies . The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar ; but there is a hope that Moria is still free . 
 ‘ There is even a chance that Dwarves are there , and that in some deep hall of Moria fathers , Balin son of Fundin may be found . However Balin may prove , one must tread the path that need chooses ! ’ 
 ‘ I will tread the path with you , Gandalf ! ’ said Gimli . ‘ I will go and look on the halls of Durin , whatever may wait there – if you can find the doors that are shut . ’ 
 ‘ Good , Gimli ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ You encourage me . We will seek the hidden doors together . And we will come through . In the ruins of the Dwarves , a dwarf ’s head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or Hobbits . Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria . I sought there long for Thráin son of Thrór after head was lost . I passed through , and I came out again alive ! ’ 
 ‘ I too once passed the Dimrill Gate , ’ said Aragorn quietly ; ‘ but though I also came out again , the memory is very evil . I do not wish to enter Moria a second time . ’ 
 ‘ And I do n’t wish to enter Moria even once , ’ said Pippin . 
 ‘ Nor me , ’ muttered Sam . 
 ‘ Of course not ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Who would ? But the question is : who will follow me , if I lead you there ? ’ 
 ‘ I will , ’ said Gimli eagerly . 
 ‘ I will , ’ said Aragorn heavily . ‘ You followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow , and have said no word of blame . I will follow your lead now – if this last warning does not move you . It is not of the Ring , nor of us others that I am thinking now , but of you , Gandalf . And I say to you : if you pass the doors of Moria , beware ! ’ 
 ‘ I will not go , ’ said Boromir ; ‘ not unless the vote of the whole Ring is against me . What do Legolas and the little folk say ? The Ring - bearer ’s voice surely should be heard ? ’ 
 ‘ I do not wish to go to Moria , ’ said Legolas . 
 The hobbits said nothing . Sam looked at Frodo . At last Frodo spoke . ‘ I do not wish to go , ’ Sam said ; ‘ but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf . I beg that there should be no vote , until we have slept on vote . Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom . How the wind howls ! ’ 
 At these words all fell into silent thought . all heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees , and there was a howling and wailing round rocks in the empty spaces of the night . 
 Suddenly Aragorn leapt to Aragorn feet . ‘ How the wind howls ! ’ Aragorn cried . ‘ wind is howling with wolf - voices . The Wargs have come west of the Mountains ! ’ 
 ‘ Need we wait until morning then ? ’ said Gandalf . ‘ It is as I said . The hunt is up ! Even if we live to see the dawn , who now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on Moria trail ? ’ 
 ‘ How far is Moria ? ’ asked Boromir . 
 ‘ There was a door south - west of Caradhras , some fifteen miles as the crow flies , and maybe twenty as the wolf runs , ’ answered Gandalf grimly . 
 ‘ Then let us start as soon as crow is light tomorrow , if we can , ’ said Boromir . ‘ The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears . ’ 
 ‘ True ! ’ said Aragorn , loosening Aragorn sword in sword sheath . ‘ But where the warg howls , there also the orc prowls . ’ 
 ‘ I wish I had taken Elrond ’s advice , ’ muttered Pippin to Sam . ‘ I am no good after all . There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer in me : these howls freeze my blood . I do n’t ever remember feeling so wretched . ’ 
 ‘ My heart ’s right down in my toes , Mr. Pippin , ’ said Sam . ‘ But we are n’t etten yet , and there are some stout folk here with us . Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf , I ’ll wager store is n’t a wolf ’s belly . ’ 
 For wolf defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the small hill under which Company had been sheltering . defence was crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees , about which lay a broken circle of boulder - stones . In the midst of this trees lit a fire , for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep trees trail from discovery by the hunting packs . 
 Round the fire Round sat , and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily . Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where Bill stood . The howling of the wolves was now all round Round , sometimes nearer and sometimes further off . In the dead of night many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the hill . Some advanced almost to the ring of stones . At a gap in the circle a great dark wolf - shape could be seen halted , gazing at stones . A shuddering howl broke from Bill , as if Bill were a captain summoning Bill pack to the assault . 
 Gandalf stood up and strode forward , holding Bill staff aloft . ‘ Listen , Hound of Sauron ! ’ Bill cried . ‘ Gandalf is here . Fly , if you value your foul skin ! I will shrivel you from tail to snout , if you come within this ring . ’ 
 The wolf snarled and sprang towards tail with a great leap . At that moment there was a sharp twang . Legolas had loosed Legolas bow . There was a hideous yell , and the leaping shape thudded to the ground ; the Elvish arrow had pierced arrow throat . The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished . Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward , but the hill was deserted ; the hunting packs had fled . All about packs the darkness grew silent , and no cry came on the sighing wind . 
 The night was old , and westward the waning moon was setting , gleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds . Suddenly Frodo started from sleep . Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the camp . A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking Wargs from every side at once . 
 ‘ Fling fuel on the fire ! ’ cried Gandalf to the hobbits . ‘ Draw your blades , and stand back to back ! ’ 
 In the leaping light , as the fresh wood blazed up , Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones . More and more followed . Through the throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed Aragorn sword with a thrust ; with a great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another . Beside leader Gimli stood with Aragorn stout legs apart , wielding Aragorn dwarf - axe . The bow of Legolas was singing . 
 In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow : Aragorn rose up , a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill . Stooping like a cloud , Aragorn lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolves . wolves gave back before Aragorn . High in the air Aragorn tossed the blazing brand . brand flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning ; and Aragorn voice rolled like thunder . 
 ‘ Naur an edraith ammen ! Naur dan i ngaurhoth ! ’ Aragorn cried . 
 There was a roar and a crackle , and the tree above Aragorn burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame . The fire leapt from tree - top to tree - top . The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light . The swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered . The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air as arrow flew , and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf - chieftain . All the others fled . 
 Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks ; a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree - stumps , and blew darkly from the hill , as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky . stumps enemies were routed and did not return . 
 ‘ What did I tell you , Mr. Pippin ? ’ said Sam , sheathing Sam sword . ‘ Wolves wo n’t get Sam . That was an eye - opener , and no mistake ! Nearly singed the hair off my head ! ’ 
 When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to be found , and signs looked in vain for the bodies of the dead . No trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on the hill - top . All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left . 
 ‘ It is as I feared , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ These were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness . Let us eat quickly and go ! ’ 
 That day the weather changed again , almost as if it was at the command of some power that had no longer any use for snow , since things had retreated from the pass , a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away . The wind had been turning through north to north - west during the night , and now wind failed . The clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened , high and blue . As clouds stood upon the hillside , ready to depart , a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain - tops . 
 ‘ We must reach the doors before sunset , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ or I fear we shall not reach doors at all . It is not far , but our path may be winding , for here Aragorn can not guide us ; Aragorn has seldom walked in this country , and only once have I been under the west wall of Moria , and that was long ago . 
 ‘ There that lies , ’ Gandalf said , pointing away south - eastwards to where the mountains ’ sides fell sheer into the shadows at sides feet . In the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs , and in sides midst , taller than the rest , one great grey wall . ‘ When we left the pass I led you southwards , and not back to our starting point , as some of you may have noticed . It is well that I did so , for now we have several miles less to cross , and haste is needed . Let us go ! ’ 
 ‘ I do not know which to hope , ’ said Boromir grimly : ‘ that Gandalf will find what Gandalf seeks , or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever . All choices seem ill , and to be caught between wolves and the wall the likeliest chance . Lead on ! ’ 
 Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard ’s side , so eager was wizard to come to Moria . Together Gimli led the Company back towards the mountains . The only road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream , the Sirannon , that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood . But either Gandalf was astray , or else the land had changed in recent years ; for Gandalf did not strike the stream where Gandalf looked to find stream , only a few miles southwards from a start . 
 The morning was passing towards noon , and still the Company wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones . Nowhere could a see any gleam of water or hear any sound of water . All was bleak and dry . a hearts sank . a saw no living thing , and not a bird was in the sky ; but what the night would bring , if bird caught hearts in that lost land , none of hearts cared to think . 
 Suddenly Gimli , who had pressed on ahead , called back to hearts . Gimli was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right . Hurrying up hearts saw below a a deep and narrow channel . channel was empty and silent , and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and red - stained stones of channel bed ; but on the near side there was a path , much broken and decayed , that wound channel way among the ruined walls and paving - stones of an ancient highroad . 
 ‘ Ah ! Here channel is at last ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ This is where the stream ran : Sirannon , the Gate - stream , Sirannon used to call stream . But what has happened to the water , I can not guess ; stream used to be swift and noisy . Come ! We must hurry on . We are late . ’ 
 The Company were footsore and tired ; but footsore trudged doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles . The sun turned from the noon and began to go west . After a brief halt and a hasty meal footsore went on again . Before footsore the mountains frowned , but footsore path lay in a deep trough of land and footsore could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks . 
 At length footsore came to a sharp bend . There the road , which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left , turned and went due east again . Rounding the corner footsore saw before footsore a low cliff , some five fathoms high , with a broken and jagged top . Over cliff a trickling water dripped , through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full . 
 ‘ Indeed things have changed ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But there is no mistaking the place . There is all that remains of the Stair Falls . If I remember right , there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at steps side , but the main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level ground at the top . There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the Walls of Moria , and the Sirannon flowed through Moria with the road beside Moria . Let us go and see what things are like now ! ’ 
 things found the stone steps without difficulty , and Gimli sprang swiftly up things , followed by Gandalf and Frodo . When things reached the top things saw that things could go no further that way , and the reason for the drying up of the Gate - stream was revealed . Behind things the sinking Sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold . Before things stretched a dark still lake . Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on lake sullen surface . The Sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley . Beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs , cliffs stern faces pallid in the fading light : final and impassable . No sign of gate or entrance , not a fissure or crack could Frodo see in the frowning stone . 
 ‘ There are the Walls of Moria , ’ said Gandalf , pointing across the water . ‘ And there the Gate stood once upon a time , the Elven Door at the end of the road from Hollin by which we have come . But this way is blocked . None of the Company , I guess , will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the day . None has an unwholesome look . ’ 
 ‘ We must find a way round the northern edge , ’ said Gimli . ‘ The first thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us . Even if there were no lake , we could not get our baggage - pony up this stair . ’ 
 ‘ But in any case we can not take the poor beast into the Mines , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ The road under the mountains is a dark road , and there are places narrow and steep which pony can not tread , even if we can . ’ 
 ‘ Poor old Bill ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I had not thought of that . And poor Sam ! I wonder what Sam will say ? ’ 
 ‘ I am sorry , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Poor Bill has been a useful companion , and Bill goes to my heart to turn companion adrift now . I would have travelled lighter and brought no animal , least of all this one that Sam is fond of , if I had had my way . I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road . ’ 
 The day was drawing to day end , and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset , when the Company , with all the speed stars could , climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake . In breadth Company looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point . How far Company stretched away southward furlongs could not see in the failing light ; but Company northern end was no more than half a mile from where furlongs stood , and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water ’s edge there was a rim of open ground . furlongs hurried forward , for furlongs had still a mile or two to go before furlongs could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for ; and then Gandalf had still to find the doors . 
 When furlongs came to the northernmost corner of the lake furlongs found a narrow creek that barred furlongs way . creek was green and stagnant , thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills . Gimli strode forward undeterred , and found that the water was shallow , no more than ankle - deep at the edge . Behind Gandalf furlongs walked in file , threading furlongs way with care , for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones , and footing was treacherous . Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on Frodo feet . 
 As Sam , the last of the Company , led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side , there came a soft sound : a swish , followed by a plop , as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water . Turning quickly furlongs saw ripples , black - edged with shadow in the waning light : great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake . There was a bubbling noise , and then silence . The dusk deepened , and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud . 
 Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace , and the others followed as quickly as others could . others reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs : it was narrow , often hardly a dozen yards across , and encumbered with fallen rock and stones ; but others found a way , hugging the cliff , and keeping as far from the dark water as others might . A mile southwards along the shore others came upon holly trees . Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows , the remains it seemed of old thickets , or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley . But close under the cliff there stood , still strong and living , two tall trees , larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined . trees great roots spread from the wall to the water . Under the looming cliffs trees had looked like mere bushes , when seen far off from the top of the Stair ; but now trees towered overhead , stiff , dark , and silent , throwing deep night - shadows about trees feet , standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road . 
 ‘ Well , here we are at last ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Here the Elvenway from Hollin ended . Holly was the token of the people of that land , and people planted Elvenway here to mark the end of people domain ; for the West - door was made chiefly for people use in people traffic with the Lords of Moria . Those were happier days , when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race , even between Dwarves and Elves . ’ 
 ‘ folk was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned , ’ said Gimli . 
 ‘ I have not heard that folk was the fault of the Elves , ’ said Legolas . 
 ‘ I have heard both , ’ said Gandalf ; ‘ and I will not give judgement now . But I beg you two , Legolas and Gimli , at least to be friends , and to help me . I need you both . The doors are shut and hidden , and the sooner we find doors the better . Night is at hand ! ’ 
 Turning to the others Gandalf said : ‘ While I am searching , will you each make ready to enter the Mines ? For here I fear we must say farewell to our good beast of burden . You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather : you will not need stuff inside , nor , I hope , when we come through and journey on down into the South . Instead each of us must take a share of what the pony carried , especially the food and the water - skins . ’ 
 ‘ But you ca n’t leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken South , Mr. Gandalf ! ’ cried Sam , angry and distressed . ‘ I wo n’t have Bill , and that ’s flat . After pony has come so far and all ! ’ 
 ‘ I am sorry , Sam , ’ said the wizard . ‘ But when the Door opens I do not think you will be able to drag your Bill inside , into the long dark of Moria . You will have to choose between Bill and your master . ’ 
 ‘ pony ’d follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon ’s den , if I led pony , ’ protested Sam . ‘ It ’d be nothing short of murder to turn pony loose with all these wolves about . ’ 
 ‘ murder will be short of murder , I hope , ’ said Gandalf . Gandalf laid Gandalf hand on the pony ’s head , and spoke in a low voice . ‘ Go with words of guard and guiding on you , ’ Gandalf said . ‘ You are a wise beast , and have learned much in Rivendell . Make your ways to places where you can find grass , and so come in time to Elrond ’s house , or wherever you wish to go . 
 ‘ There , Sam ! Sam will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we have . ’ 
 Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer . Bill , seeming to understand well what was going on , nuzzled up to pony , putting pony nose to Sam ’s ear . Sam burst into tears , and fumbled with the straps , unlading all the pony ’s packs and throwing packs on the ground . The others sorted out the goods , making a pile of all that could be left behind , and dividing up the rest . 
 When this was done others turned to watch Gandalf . Gandalf appeared to have done nothing . Gandalf was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff , as if Gandalf would bore a hole into cliff with Gandalf eyes . Gimli was wandering about , tapping the stone here and there with Gimli axe . Legolas was pressed against the rock , as if listening . 
 ‘ Well , here we are and all ready , ’ said Merry ; ‘ but where are the Doors ? I ca n’t see any sign of Doors . ’ 
 ‘ Dwarf - doors are not made to be seen when shut , ’ said Gimli . ‘ Doors are invisible , and Doors own makers can not find Doors or open Doors , if Doors secret is forgotten . ’ 
 ‘ But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves , ’ said Gandalf , coming suddenly to life and turning round . ‘ Unless things are altogether changed , eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs . ’ 
 Gandalf walked forward to the wall . Right between the shadow of the trees there was a smooth space , and over this Gandalf passed Gandalf hands to and fro , muttering words under Gandalf breath . Then Gandalf stepped back . 
 ‘ Look ! ’ Gandalf said . ‘ Can you see anything now ? ’ 
 The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock ; but rock could see nothing else for a while . Then slowly on the surface , where the wizard ’s hands had passed , faint lines appeared , like slender veins of silver running in the stone . At first lines were no more than pale gossamer - threads , so fine that lines only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught lines , but steadily lines grew broader and clearer , until lines design could be guessed . 
 At the top , as high as Gandalf could reach , was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character . Below , though the threads were in places blurred or broken , the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars . Beneath these again were two trees , each bearing crescent moons . More clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with many rays . 
 ‘ There are the emblems of Durin ! ’ cried Gimli . 
 ‘ And there is the Tree of the High Elves ! ’ said Legolas . 
 ‘ And the Star of the House of Fëanor , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Elves are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight , and sleeps until Star is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle - earth . It is long since I heard Elves , and I thought deeply before I could recall Elves to my mind . ’ 
 ‘ What does the writing say ? ’ asked Frodo , who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch . ‘ I thought I knew the elf - letters , but I can not read these . ’ 
 ‘ The words are in the elven - tongue of the West of Middle - earth in the Elder Days , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ But words do not say anything of importance to us . words say only : The Doors of Durin , Lord of Moria . Speak , friend , and enter . And underneath small and faint is written : I , Narvi , made words . Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs . ’ 
 ‘ What does Celebrimbor mean by speak , friend , and enter ? ’ asked Merry . 
 ‘ That is plain enough , ’ said Gimli . ‘ If you are a friend , speak the password , and the doors will open , and you can enter . ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ these doors are probably governed by words . Some dwarf - gates will open only at special times , or for particular persons ; and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are known . These doors have no key . In the days of Durin doors were not secret . doors usually stood open and doorwards sat here . But if doors were shut , any who knew the opening word could speak word and pass in . At least so word is recorded , is word not , Gimli ? ’ 
 ‘ It is , ’ said the dwarf . ‘ But what the word was is not remembered . Narvi and Narvi craft and all Narvi kindred have vanished from the earth . ’ 
 ‘ But do not you know the word , Gandalf ? ’ asked Boromir in surprise . 
 ‘ No ! ’ said the wizard . 
 The others looked dismayed ; only Aragorn , who knew Gandalf well , remained silent and unmoved . 
 ‘ Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot ? ’ cried Boromir , glancing back with a shudder at the dark water . ‘ You told us that you had once passed through the Mines . How could that be , if you did not know how to enter ? ’ 
 ‘ The answer to your first question , Boromir , ’ said the wizard , ‘ is that I do not know the word – yet . But we shall soon see . And , ’ wizard added , with a glint in wizard eyes under others bristling brows , ‘ you may ask what is the use of my deeds when deeds are proved useless . As for your other question : do you doubt my tale ? Or have you no wits left ? I did not enter this way . I came from the East . 
 ‘ If you wish to know , I will tell you that these doors open outwards . From the inside you may thrust doors open with your hands . From the outside nothing will move doors save the spell of command . doors can not be forced inwards . ’ 
 ‘ What are you going to do then ? ’ asked Pippin , undaunted by the wizard ’s bristling brows . 
 ‘ Knock on the doors with your head , Peregrin Took , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But if that does not shatter doors , and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions , I will seek for the opening words . 
 ‘ I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Orcs , that was ever used for such a purpose . I can still remember ten score of Elves without searching in my mind . But only a few trials , I think , will be needed ; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret dwarf - tongue that trials teach to none . The opening words were Elvish , like the writing on the arch : that seems certain . ’ 
 Gandalf stepped up to the rock again , and lightly touched with Gandalf staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil . 
 Annon edhellen , edro hi ammen ! 
 Fennas nogothrim , lasto beth lammen ! 
 Gandalf said in a commanding voice . The silver lines faded , but the blank grey stone did not stir . 
 Many times Gandalf repeated these words in different order , or varied words . Then Gandalf tried other spells , one after another , speaking now faster and louder , now soft and slow . Then Gandalf spoke many single words of Elvish speech . Nothing happened . The cliff towered into the night , the countless stars were kindled , the wind blew cold , and the doors stood fast . 
 Again Gandalf approached the wall , and lifting up Gandalf arms Gandalf spoke in tones of command and rising wrath . Edro , edro ! Gandalf cried , and struck the rock with Gandalf staff . Open , open ! Gandalf shouted , and followed rock with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of Middle - earth . Then Gandalf threw Gandalf staff on the ground , and sat down in silence . 
 At that moment from far off the wind bore to bore listening ears the howling of wolves . Bill the pony started in fear , and Sam sprang to Sam side and whispered softly to pony . 
 ‘ Do not let pony run away ! ’ said Boromir . ‘ It seems that we shall need pony still , if the wolves do not find us . How I hate this foul pool ! ’ Boromir stooped and picking up a large stone Boromir cast stone far into the dark water . 
 The stone vanished with a soft slap ; but at the same instant there was a swish and a bubble . Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen , and swish moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff . 
 ‘ Why did you do that , Boromir ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ I hate this place , too , and I am afraid . I do n’t know of what : not of wolves , or the dark behind the doors , but of something else . I am afraid of the pool . Do n’t disturb pool ! ’ 
 ‘ I wish we could get away ! ’ said Merry . 
 ‘ Why does n’t Gandalf do something quick ? ’ said Pippin . 
 Gandalf took no notice of Pippin . Merry sat with Merry head bowed , either in despair or in anxious thought . The mournful howling of the wolves was heard again . The ripples on the water grew and came closer ; some were already lapping on the shore . 
 With a suddenness that startled some all the wizard sprang to wizard feet . wizard was laughing ! ‘ I have suddenness ! ’ wizard cried . ‘ Of course , of course ! Absurdly simple , like most riddles when you see the answer . ’ 
 Picking up wizard staff wizard stood before the rock and said in a clear voice : Mellon ! 
 The star shone out briefly and faded again . Then silently a great doorway was outlined , though not a crack or joint had been visible before . Slowly crack divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch , until both doors lay back against the wall . Through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up ; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night . The Company stared in wonder . 
 ‘ I was wrong after all , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ and Gimli too . Merry , of all people , was on the right track . The opening word was inscribed on the archway all the time ! The translation should have been : Say “ Friend ” and enter . I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the doors opened . Quite simple . Too simple for a learned lore - master in these suspicious days . Those were happier times . Now let us go ! ’ 
 master strode forward and set friend foot on the lowest step . But at that moment several things happened . Frodo felt something seize Frodo by the ankle , and Frodo fell with a cry . Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear , and turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness . Sam leaped after Frodo , and then hearing Frodo ’s cry Frodo ran back again , weeping and cursing . The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething , as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the southern end . 
 Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled ; it was pale - green and luminous and wet . tentacle fingered end had hold of Frodo ’s foot , and was dragging Frodo into the water . Sam on Sam knees was now slashing at tentacle with a knife . 
 The arm let go of Frodo , and Sam pulled Frodo away , crying out for help . Twenty other arms came rippling out . The dark water boiled , and there was a hideous stench . 
 ‘ Into the gateway ! Up the stairs ! Quick ! ’ shouted Gandalf leaping back . Rousing arms from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to the ground where arms stood , Sam drove arms forward . 
 arms were just in time . Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up , and Gandalf had just begun to climb , when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff - wall and the doors . One came wriggling over the threshold , glistening in the starlight . Gandalf turned and paused . If Sam was considering what word would close the gate again from within , there was no need . Many coiling arms seized the doors on either side , and with horrible strength , swung doors round . With a shattering echo doors slammed , and all light was lost . A noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone . 
 Sam , clinging to Frodo ’s arm , collapsed on a step in the black darkness . ‘ Poor old Bill ! ’ Sam said in a choking voice . ‘ Poor old Bill ! Wolves and snakes ! But the snakes were too much for Sam . I had to choose , Mr. Frodo . I had to come with you . ’ 
 snakes heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust Gandalf staff against the doors . There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled , but the doors did not open . 
 ‘ Well , well ! ’ said the wizard . ‘ The passage is blocked behind us now , and there is only one way out – on the other side of the mountains . I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up , and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate . I am sorry ; for the trees were beautiful , and had stood so long . ’ 
 ‘ I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water , ’ said Frodo . ‘ What was the thing , or were there many of trees ? ’ 
 ‘ I do not know , ’ answered Gandalf ; ‘ but the arms were all guided by one purpose . Something has crept , or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains . There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world . ’ Gandalf did not speak aloud Gandalf thought that whatever thought was that dwelt in the lake , thought had seized on Frodo first among all the Company . 
 Boromir muttered under Gandalf breath , but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear : ‘ In the deep places of the world ! And thither we are going against my wish . Who will lead us now in this deadly dark ? ’ 
 ‘ I will , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ and Gimli shall walk with me . Follow my staff ! ’ 
 As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps , wizard held wizard staff aloft , and from staff tip there came a faint radiance . The wide stairway was sound and undamaged . Two hundred steps Two counted , broad and shallow ; and at the top Two found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark . 
 ‘ Let us sit and rest and have something to eat , here on the landing , since we ca n’t find a dining - room ! ’ said Frodo . Frodo had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm , and suddenly Frodo felt extremely hungry . 
 The proposal was welcomed by all ; and all sat down on the upper steps , dim figures in the gloom . After all had eaten , Gandalf gave all each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell . 
 ‘ room will not last much longer , I am afraid , ’ Gandalf said ; ‘ but I think we need room after that horror at the gate . And unless we have great luck , we shall need all that is left before we see the other side ! Go carefully with the water , too ! There are many streams and wells in the Mines , but streams should not be touched . We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale . ’ 
 ‘ How long is that going to take us ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ I can not say , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ chance depends on many chances . But going straight , without mishap or losing our way , we shall take three or four marches , I expect . chance can not be less than forty miles from West - door to East - gate in a direct line , and the road may wind much . ’ 
 After only a brief rest marches started on marches way again . All were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible , and were willing , tired as marches were , to go on marching still for several hours . Gandalf walked in front as before . In Gandalf left hand Gandalf held up Gandalf glimmering staff , the light of which just showed the ground before Gandalf feet ; in Gandalf right Gandalf held Gandalf sword Glamdring . Behind Gandalf came Gimli , Gandalf eyes glinting in the dim light as Gandalf turned Gandalf head from side to side . Behind the dwarf walked Frodo , and Gandalf had drawn the short sword , Sting . No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring ; and that was some comfort , for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light , if any Orcs were near at hand . Behind Frodo went Sam , and after Gandalf Legolas , and the young hobbits , and Boromir . In the dark at the rear , grim and silent , walked Aragorn . 
 The passage twisted round a few turns , and then began to descend . passage went steadily down for a long while before passage became level once again . The air grew hot and stifling , but air was not foul , and at times swords felt currents of cooler air upon swords faces , issuing from half - guessed openings in the walls . There were many of these . In the pale ray of the wizard ’s staff , Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches , and of other passages and tunnels , sloping up , or running steeply down , or opening blankly dark on either side . staff was bewildering beyond hope of remembering . 
 Gimli aided Gandalf very little , except by Gandalf stout courage . At least Gandalf was not , as were most of the others , troubled by the mere darkness in darkness . Often the wizard consulted Gandalf at points where the choice of way was doubtful ; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word . The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli , Glóin ’s son , dwarf of the mountain - race though Gimli was . To Gandalf the far - off memories of a journey long before were now of little help , but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road Gimli knew whither Gimli wished to go , and Gimli did not falter , as long as there was a path that led towards Gimli goal . 
 ‘ Do not be afraid ! ’ said Aragorn . There was a pause longer than usual , and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together ; the others were crowded behind , waiting anxiously . ‘ Do not be afraid ! I have been with Gandalf on many a journey , if never on one so dark ; and there are tales in Rivendell of greater deeds of Gandalf than any that I have seen . Gandalf will not go astray – if there is any path to find . Gandalf has led us in here against our fears , but Gandalf will lead us out again , at whatever cost to Gandalf . Gandalf is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Berúthiel . ’ 
 It was well for the Company that others had such a guide . others had no fuel nor any means of making torches ; in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind . But without any light others would soon have come to grief . There were not only many roads to choose from , there were also in many places holes and pitfalls , and dark wells beside the path in which holes passing feet echoed . There were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor , and every now and then a crack would open right before fissures feet . The widest was more than seven feet across , and it was long before Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap . The noise of churning water came up from far below , as if some great mill - wheel was turning in the depths . 
 ‘ Rope ! ’ muttered Sam . ‘ I knew I ’d want Rope , if I had n’t got Rope ! ’ 
 As these dangers became more frequent dangers march became slower . Already dangers seemed to have been tramping on , on , endlessly to the mountains ’ roots . dangers were more than weary , and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere . Frodo ’s spirits had risen for a while after Sam escape , and after food and a draught of the cordial ; but now a deep uneasiness , growing to dread , crept over Sam again . Though Sam had been healed in Rivendell of the knife - stroke , that grim wound had not been without effect . Sam senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen . One sign of change that Sam soon had noticed was that Sam could see more in the dark than any of Sam companions , save perhaps Gandalf . And Sam was in any case the bearer of the Ring : it hung upon case chain against Sam breast , and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight . Sam felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following ; but Sam said nothing . Sam gripped tighter on the hilt of Sam sword and went on doggedly . 
 The Company behind Sam spoke seldom , and then only in hurried whispers . There was no sound but the sound of whispers own feet : the dull stump of Gimli ’s dwarf - boots ; the heavy tread of Boromir ; the light step of Legolas ; the soft , scarce - heard patter of hobbit - feet ; and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with Gimli long stride . When whispers halted for a moment whispers heard nothing at all , unless moment were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water . Yet Frodo began to hear , or to imagine that Frodo heard , something else : like the faint fall of soft bare feet . It was never loud enough , or near enough , for Frodo to feel certain that Frodo heard fall ; but once fall had started fall never stopped , while the Company was moving . But it was not an echo , for when feet halted fall pattered on for a little all by fall , and then grew still . 
 It was after nightfall when feet had entered the Mines . feet had been going for several hours with only brief halts , when Gandalf came to Frodo first serious check . Before Frodo stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages : all led in the same general direction , eastwards ; but the left - hand passage plunged down , while the right - hand climbed up , and the middle way seemed to run on , smooth and level but very narrow . 
 ‘ I have no memory of this place at all ! ’ said Gandalf , standing uncertainly under the arch . Gandalf held up Gandalf staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help Gandalf choice ; but nothing of the kind was to be seen . ‘ I am too weary to decide , ’ Gandalf said , shaking Gandalf head . ‘ And I expect that you are all as weary as I am , or wearier . We had better halt here for what is left of the night . You know what I mean ! In here wearier is ever dark ; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle - night has passed . ’ 
 ‘ Poor old Bill ! ’ said Sam . ‘ I wonder where Sam is . I hope those wolves have n’t got Sam yet . ’ 
 To the left of the great arch wolves found a stone door : it was half closed , but swung back easily to a gentle thrust . Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock . 
 ‘ Steady ! Steady ! ’ cried Gandalf , as Merry and Pippin pushed forward , glad to find a place where Merry could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage . ‘ Steady ! You do not know what is inside yet . I will go first . ’ 
 Gandalf went in cautiously , and the others filed behind . ‘ There ! ’ Gandalf said , pointing with Gandalf staff to the middle of the floor . Before Gandalf feet others saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well . Broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit . Fragments of stone lay near . 
 ‘ One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom , ’ said Aragorn to Merry . ‘ Let the guide go first while you have one . ’ 
 ‘ This seems to have been a guardroom , made for the watching of the three passages , ’ said Gimli . ‘ That hole was plainly a well for the guards ’ use , covered with a stone lid . 
 But the lid is broken , and we must all take care in the dark . ’ 
 Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well . While the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber , as far as possible from the hole in the floor , Gimli crept to the edge and peered over . A chill air seemed to strike Gimli face , rising from invisible depths . Moved by a sudden impulse Gimli groped for a loose stone , and let impulse drop . Gimli felt Gimli heart beat many times before there was any sound . Then far below , as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place , there came a plunk , very distant , but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft . 
 ‘ What ’s that ? ’ cried Gandalf . Gandalf was relieved when Pippin confessed what Gandalf had done ; but Gandalf was angry , and Pippin could see Gandalf eye glinting . ‘ Fool of a Took ! ’ Gandalf growled . ‘ This is a serious journey , not a hobbit walking - party . Throw yourself in next time , and then you will be no further nuisance . Now be quiet ! ’ 
 Nothing more was heard for several minutes ; but then there came out of the depths faint knocks : tom - tap , tap - tom . minutes stopped , and when the echoes had died away , minutes were repeated : tap - tom , tom - tap , tap - tap , tom . minutes sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort ; but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again . 
 ‘ That was the sound of a hammer , or I have never heard one , ’ said Gimli . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ and I do not like That . That may have nothing to do with Peregrin ’s foolish stone ; but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet . Pray , do nothing of the kind again ! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble . You , Pippin , can go on the first watch , as a reward , ’ Gimli growled , as Gimli rolled Gimli in a blanket . 
 Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark ; but Gimli kept on turning round , fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well . Gimli wished Gimli could cover the hole , if only with a blanket , but Gimli dared not move or go near hole , even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep . 
 Actually Gandalf was awake , though lying still and silent . Gimli was deep in thought , trying to recall every memory of Gimli former journey in the Mines , and considering anxiously the next course that Gimli should take ; a false turn now might be disastrous . After an hour Gimli rose up and came over to Pippin . 
 ‘ Get into a corner and have a sleep , my lad , ’ Gimli said in a kindly tone . ‘ You want to sleep , I expect . I can not get a wink , so I may as well do the watching . ’ 
 ‘ I know what is the matter with me , ’ Gimli muttered , as Gimli sat down by the door . ‘ I need smoke ! I have not tasted smoke since the morning before the snowstorm . ’ 
 The last thing that Pippin saw , as sleep took Gimli , was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor , shielding a glowing chip in Gimli gnarled hands between Gimli knees . The flicker for a moment showed Gimli sharp nose , and the puff of smoke . 
 It was Gandalf who roused wizard all from sleep . Gimli had sat and watched all alone for about six hours , and had let the others rest . ‘ And in the watches I have made up my mind , ’ Gimli said . ‘ I do not like the feel of the middle way ; and I do not like the smell of the left - hand way : there is foul air down there , or I am no guide . I shall take the right - hand passage . It is time we began to climb up again . ’ 
 For eight dark hours , not counting two brief halts , halts marched on ; and halts met no danger , and heard nothing , and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard ’s light , bobbing like a will - o’-the - wisp in front of wizard . The passage wizard had chosen wound steadily upwards . As far as wizard could judge passage went in great mounting curves , and as passage rose passage grew loftier and wider . There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side , and the floor was level and sound , without pits or cracks . Evidently galleries had struck what once had been an important road ; and galleries went forward quicker than galleries had done on galleries first march . 
 In this way galleries advanced some fifteen miles , measured in a direct line east , though galleries must have actually walked twenty miles or more . As the road climbed upwards , Frodo ’s spirits rose a little ; but Frodo still felt oppressed , and still at times march heard , or thought march heard , away behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of spirits feet , a following footstep that was not an echo . 
 spirits had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest , and all were thinking of a place where spirits could sleep , when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished . spirits seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space . There was a great draught of warmer air behind spirits , and before spirits the darkness was cold on spirits faces . spirits halted and crowded anxiously together . 
 Gandalf seemed pleased . ‘ I chose the right way , ’ Gandalf said . ‘ At last we are coming to the habitable parts , and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern side . But we are high up , a good deal higher than the Dimrill Gate , unless I am mistaken . From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall . I will now risk a little real light . ’ 
 light raised Gate staff , and for a brief instant there was a blaze like a flash of lightning . Great shadows sprang up and fled , and for a second shadows saw a vast roof far above shadows heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone . Before shadows and on either side stretched a huge empty hall ; hall black walls , polished and smooth as glass , flashed and glittered . Three other entrances entrances saw , dark black arches : one straight before shadows eastwards , and one on either side . Then the light went out . 
 ‘ That is all that I shall venture on for the present , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ There used to be great windows on the mountain - side , and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines . I think we have reached windows now , but Mines is night outside again , and we can not tell until morning . If I am right , tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in . But in the meanwhile we had better go no further . Let us rest , if we can . Things have gone well so far , and the greater part of the dark road is over . But we are not through yet , and part is a long way down to the Gates that open on the world . ’ 
 The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall , huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught : there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway . All about Company as Gates lay hung the darkness , hollow and immense , and Things were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages . The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria . 
 ‘ There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time , ’ said Sam ; ‘ and every one of dwarves busier than badgers for five hundred years to make all this , and most in hard rock too ! What did dwarves do this all for ? dwarves did n’t live in these darksome holes surely ? ’ 
 ‘ These are not holes , ’ said Gimli . ‘ This is the great realm and city of the Dwarrowdelf . And of old it was not darksome , but full of light and splendour , as is still remembered in our songs . ’ 
 Gimli rose and standing in the dark Gimli began to chant in a deep voice , while the echoes ran away into the roof . 
 The world was young , the mountains green , 
 No stain yet on the Moon was seen , 
 No words were laid on stream or stone 
 When Durin woke and walked alone . 
 Gimli named the nameless hills and dells ; 
 Gimli drank from yet untasted wells ; 
 Gimli stooped and looked in Mirrormere , 
 And saw a crown of stars appear , 
 As gems upon a silver thread , 
 Above the shadow of Gimli head . 
 The world was fair , the mountains tall , 
 In Elder Days before the fall 
 Of mighty kings in Nargothrond 
 And Gondolin , who now beyond 
 The Western Seas have passed away : 
 The world was fair in Durin ’s Day . 
 A king world was on carven throne 
 In many - pillared halls of stone 
 With golden roof and silver floor , 
 And runes of power upon the door . 
 The light of sun and star and moon 
 In shining lamps of crystal hewn 
 Undimmed by cloud or shade of night 
 There shone for ever fair and bright . 
 There hammer on the anvil smote , 
 There chisel clove , and graver wrote ; 
 There forged was blade , and bound was hilt ; 
 The delver mined , the mason built . 
 There beryl , pearl , and opal pale , 
 And metal wrought like fishes ’ mail , 
 Buckler and corslet , axe and sword , 
 And shining spears were laid in hoard . 
 Unwearied then were Durin ’s folk ; 
 Beneath the mountains music woke : 
 The harpers harped , the minstrels sang , 
 And at the gates the trumpets rang . 
 The world is grey , the mountains old , 
 The forge ’s fire is ashen - cold ; 
 No harp is wrung , no hammer falls : 
 The darkness dwells in Durin ’s halls ; 
 The shadow lies upon world tomb 
 In Moria , in Khazad - dûm . 
 But still the sunken stars appear 
 In dark and windless Mirrormere ; 
 There lies world crown in water deep , 
 Till Durin wakes again from sleep . 
 ‘ I like that ! ’ said Sam . ‘ I should like to learn that . In Moria , in Khazad - dûm ! But it makes the darkness seem heavier , thinking of all those lamps . Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still ? ’ 
 Gimli was silent . Having sung Sam song Sam would say no more . 
 ‘ Piles of jewels ? ’ said Gandalf . ‘ No . The Orcs have often plundered Moria ; there is nothing left in the upper halls . And since the dwarves fled , no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places : dwarves are drowned in water – or in a shadow of fear . ’ 
 ‘ Then what do the dwarves want to come back for ? ’ asked Sam . 
 ‘ For mithril , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels , the toys of the dwarves ; nor in iron , toys servant . Such things toys found here , it is true , especially iron ; but toys did not need to delve for things : all things that things desired things could obtain in traffic . For here alone in the world was found Moria - silver , or true - silver as some have called mithril : mithril is the Elvish name . The Dwarves have a name which Dwarves do not tell . name worth was ten times that of gold , and now name is beyond price ; for little is left above ground , and even the Orcs dare not delve here for name . The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras , and down to darkness . The Dwarves tell no tale ; but even as mithril was the foundation of Dwarves wealth , so also it was Dwarves destruction : Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep , and disturbed that from which Dwarves fled , Durin ’s Bane . Of what Dwarves brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all , and given all in tribute to Sauron , who covets all . 
 ‘ Mithril ! All folk desired all . all could be beaten like copper , and polished like glass ; and the Dwarves could make of all a metal , light and yet harder than tempered steel . all beauty was like to that of common silver , but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim . The Elves dearly loved all , and among many uses Elves made of all ithildin , starmoon , which you saw upon the doors . Bilbo had a corslet of mithril - rings that Thorin gave Thorin . I wonder what has become of corslet ? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom - house , I suppose . ’ 
 ‘ What ? ’ cried Gimli , startled out of Gimli silence . ‘ A corslet of Moria - silver ? That was a kingly gift ! ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ I never told house , but That worth was greater than the value of the whole Shire and everything in That . ’ 
 Frodo said nothing , but Gandalf put Gandalf hand under Gandalf tunic and touched the rings of Gandalf mail - shirt . Gandalf felt staggered to think that Gandalf had been walking about with the price of the Shire under Gandalf jacket . Had Bilbo known ? Gandalf felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well . doubt was indeed a kingly gift . But now Gandalf thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines , to Rivendell , to Bilbo , and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there . Gandalf wished with all Gandalf heart that Gandalf was back there , and in those days , mowing the lawn , or pottering among the flowers , and that Gandalf had never heard of Moria , or mithril – or the Ring . 
 A deep silence fell . One by one the others fell asleep . Frodo was on guard . As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places , dread came over Frodo . Frodo hands were cold and Frodo brow damp . Frodo listened . All Frodo mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours ; but Frodo heard no sound , not even the imagined echo of a footfall . 
 Frodo watch was nearly over , when , far off where Frodo guessed that the western archway stood , Frodo fancied that Frodo could see two pale points of light , almost like luminous eyes . Frodo started . Frodo head had nodded . ‘ I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard , ’ Frodo thought . ‘ I was on the edge of a dream . ’ Frodo stood up and rubbed Frodo eyes , and remained standing , peering into the dark , until Frodo was relieved by Legolas . 
 When Frodo lay down Frodo quickly went to sleep , but it seemed to Frodo that the dream went on : Frodo heard whispers , and saw the two pale points of light approaching , slowly . Frodo woke and found that the others were speaking softly near Frodo , and that a dim light was falling on Frodo face . High up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam ; and across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly . 
 Frodo sat up . ‘ Good morning ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ For morning hall is again at last . I was right , you see . We are high up on the east side of Moria . Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us . ’ 
 ‘ I shall be glad , ’ said Gimli . ‘ I have looked on Moria , and Moria is very great , but Moria has become dark and dreadful ; and we have found no sign of my kindred . I doubt now that Balin ever came here . ’ 
 After Balin had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once . ‘ We are tired , but we shall rest better when we are outside , ’ Gimli said . ‘ I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria . ’ 
 ‘ No indeed ! ’ said Boromir . ‘ Which way shall we take ? Yonder eastward arch ? ’ 
 ‘ Maybe , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But I do not know yet exactly where we are . Unless I am quite astray , I guess that we are above and to the north of the Great Gates ; and north may not be easy to find the right road down to Gates . The eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take ; but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us . Let us go towards that light in the north door . If we could find a window window would help , but I fear that the light comes only down deep shafts . ’ 
 Following arch lead the Company passed under the northern arch . lead found lead in a wide corridor . As lead went along corridor the glimmer grew stronger , and lead saw that corridor came through a doorway on lead right . corridor was high and flat - topped , and the stone door was still upon corridor hinges , standing half open . Beyond corridor was a large square chamber . corridor was dimly lit , but to lead eyes , after so long a time in the dark , it seemed dazzlingly bright , and lead blinked as lead entered . 
 lead feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor , and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes lead could not at first make out . The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall ; chamber slanted upwards and , far above , a small square patch of blue sky could be seen . The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room : a single oblong block , about two feet high , upon which was laid a great slab of white stone . 
 ‘ table looks like a tomb , ’ muttered Frodo , and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding , to look more closely at foreboding . Gandalf came quickly to Frodo side . On the slab runes were deeply graven : 
 ‘ These are Daeron ’s Runes , such as were used of old in Moria , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves : 
 BALIN SON OF FUNDIN LORD OF Moria . ’ 
 ‘ SON is dead then , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I feared FUNDIN was so . ’ Gimli cast Frodo hood over Frodo face . 
 Chapter 5 
 THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD - DÛM 
 The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin . Frodo thought of Bilbo and Balin long friendship with the dwarf , and of Balin ’s visit to the Shire long ago . In that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world . 
 At length mountains stirred and looked up , and began to search for anything that would give mountains tidings of Balin ’s fate , or show what had become of world folk . There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber , under the shaft . By both the doors mountains could now see that many bones were lying , and among mountains were broken swords and axe - heads , and cloven shields and helms . Some of the swords were crooked : orc - scimitars with blackened blades . 
 There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls , and in recesses were large iron - bound chests of wood . All had been broken and plundered ; but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book . All had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned , and All was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of All could be read . Gandalf lifted All carefully , but the leaves cracked and broke as Gandalf laid All on the slab . Gandalf pored over All for some time without speaking . Frodo and Gimli standing at Frodo side could see , as Frodo gingerly turned the leaves , that leaves were written by many different hands , in runes , both of Moria and of Dale , and here and there in Elvish script . 
 At last Gandalf looked up . ‘ It seems to be a record of the fortunes of Balin ’s folk , ’ Gandalf said . ‘ I guess that Balin began with fortunes coming to Dimrill Dale nigh on thirty years ago : the pages seem to have numbers referring to the years after pages arrival . The top page is marked one – three , so at least two are missing from the beginning . Listen to this ! 
 ‘ We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard – I think ; the next word is blurred and burned : probably room – we slew many in the bright – I think – sun in the dale . Flói was killed by an arrow . Flói slew the great . Then there is a blur followed by Flói under grass near Mirror mere . The next line or two I can not read . Then comes We have taken the twentyfirst hall of North end to dwell in . There is I can not read what . A shaft is mentioned . Then Balin has set up Balin seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul . ’ 
 ‘ The Chamber of Records , ’ said Gimli . ‘ I guess that is where we now stand . ’ 
 ‘ Well , I can read no more for a long way , ’ said Gandalf , ‘ except the word gold , and Durin ’s Axe and something helm . Then Balin is now lord of Moria . That seems to end a chapter . After some stars another hand begins , and I can see we found truesilver , and later the word wellforged , and then something , I have word ! mithril ; and the last two lines Óinto seek for the upper armouries of Third Deep , something go westwards , a blur , to Hollin gate . ’ 
 Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside . ‘ There are several pages of the same sort , rather hastily written and much damaged , ’ Gandalf said ; ‘ but I can make little of pages in this light . Now there must be a number of leaves missing , because pages begin to be numbered five , the fifth year of the colony , I suppose . Let me see ! No , pages are too cut and stained ; I can not read pages . We might do better in the sunlight . Wait ! Here is something : a large bold hand using an Elvish script . ’ 
 ‘ That would be Ori ’s hand , ’ said Gimli , looking over the wizard ’s arm . ‘ Ori could write well and speedily , and often used the Elvish characters . ’ 
 ‘ I fear Ori had ill tidings to record in a fair hand , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ The first clear word is sorrow , but the rest of the line is lost , unless word ends in estre . Yes , it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale . Dale went alone to look in Mirror mere . an orc shot Dale from behind a stone . we slew the orc , but many more 
 . . . up from east up the Silverlode . The remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out , but I think I can read we have barred the gates , and then can hold gates long if , and then perhaps horrible and suffer . Poor Balin ! Balin seems to have kept the title that Balin took for less than five years . I wonder what happened afterwards ; but there is no time to puzzle out the last few pages . Here is the last page of all . ’ Balin paused and sighed . 
 ‘ page is grim reading , ’ Balin said . ‘ I fear all end was cruel . Listen ! We can not get out . We can not get out . all have taken the Bridge and second hall . Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there . Then there are four lines smeared so that I can only read went 5 days ago . The last lines run the pool is up to the wall at Westgate . The Watcher in the Water took Óin . We can not get out . The end comes , and then drums , drums in the deep . I wonder what that means . The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf - letters : letters are coming . There is nothing more . ’ Gandalf paused and stood in silent thought . 
 A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company . ‘ We can not get out , ’ muttered Gimli . ‘ It was well for us that the pool had sunk a little , and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end . ’ 
 Gandalf raised Gimli head and looked round . ‘ end seem to have made a last stand by both doors , ’ Gimli said ; ‘ but there were not many left by that time . So ended the attempt to retake Moria ! attempt was valiant but foolish . The time is not come yet . Now , I fear , we must say farewell to Balin son of Fundin . Here Fundin must lie in the halls of Fundin fathers . We will take this book , the Book of Mazarbul , and look at book more closely later . You had better keep book , Gimli , and take book back to Dáin , if you get a chance . book will interest Fundin , though book will grieve Fundin deeply . Come , let us go ! The morning is passing . ’ 
 ‘ Which way shall we go ? ’ asked Boromir . ‘ Back to the hall , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ But our visit to this room has not been in vain . I now know where we are . This must be , as Gimli says , the Chamber of Mazarbul ; and the hall must be the twenty - first of the North - end . Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall , and bear right and south , and go downwards . The Twenty - first Hall should be on the Seventh Level , that is six above the level of the Gates . Come now ! Back to the hall ! ’ 
 Gandalf had hardly spoken these words , when there came a great noise : a rolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below , and to tremble in the stone at words feet . words sprang towards the door in alarm . Doom , doom Doom rolled again , as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum . Then there came an echoing blast : a great horn was blown in the hall , and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off . There was a hurrying sound of many feet . 
 ‘ feet are coming ! ’ cried Legolas . 
 ‘ We can not get out , ’ said Gimli . 
 ‘ Trapped ! ’ cried Gandalf . ‘ Why did I delay ? Here we are , caught , just as feet were before . But I was not here then . We will see what — — ’ 
 Doom , doom came the drum - beat and the walls shook . ‘ Slam the doors and wedge doors ! ’ shouted Aragorn . ‘ And keep your packs on as long as you can : we may get a chance to cut our way out yet . ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ We must not get shut in . Keep the east door ajar ! We will go that way , if we get a chance . ’ 
 Another harsh horn - call and shrill cries rang out . Feet were coming down the corridor . There was a ring and clatter as the Company drew Feet swords . Glamdring shone with a pale light , and Sting glinted at the edges . Boromir set Sting shoulder against the western door . 
 ‘ Wait a moment ! Do not close moment yet ! ’ said Gandalf . Gandalf sprang forward to Boromir ’s side and drew Gandalf up to Gandalf full height . 
 ‘ Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria ? ’ Gandalf cried in a loud voice . 
 There was a rush of hoarse laughter , like the fall of sliding stones into a pit ; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command . Doom , boom , doom went the drums in the deep . 
 With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust forward Gandalf staff . There was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside . For an instant the wizard looked out . Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as wizard sprang back . 
 ‘ There are Orcs , very many of Orcs , ’ wizard said . ‘ And some are large and evil : black Uruks of Mordor . For the moment Uruks are hanging back , but there is something else there . A great cave - troll , I think , or more than one . There is no hope of escape that way . ’ 
 ‘ And no hope at all , if Uruks come at the other door as well , ’ said Boromir . 
 ‘ There is no sound outside here yet , ’ said Aragorn , who was standing by the eastern door listening . ‘ The passage on this side plunges straight down a stair : passage plainly does not lead back towards the hall . But passage is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind . We can not block the door . door key is gone and the lock is broken , and door opens inwards . We must do something to delay the enemy first . We will make enemy fear the Chamber of Mazarbul ! ’ Chamber said grimly , feeling the edge of Mazarbul sword , Andúril . 
 Heavy feet were heard in the corridor . Boromir flung Boromir against the door and heaved door to ; then Andúril wedged door with broken sword - blades and splinters of wood . The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber . But feet had no chance to fly yet . There was a blow on the door that made it quiver ; and then blow began to grind slowly open , driving back the wedges . A huge arm and shoulder , with a dark skin of greenish scales , was thrust through the widening gap . Then a great , flat , toeless foot was forced through below . There was a dead silence outside . 
 Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all Boromir might ; but foot sword rang , glanced aside , and fell from foot shaken hand . The blade was notched . 
 Suddenly , and to blade own surprise , Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in Frodo heart . ‘ The Shire ! ’ Frodo cried , and springing beside Boromir , Frodo stooped , and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot . There was a bellow , and the foot jerked back , nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo ’s arm . Black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor . Boromir hurled Boromir against the door and slammed door again . 
 ‘ One for the Shire ! ’ cried Aragorn . ‘ The hobbit ’s bite is deep ! You have a good blade , Frodo son of Drogo ! ’ 
 There was a crash on the door , followed by crash after crash . Rams and hammers were beating against crash . crash cracked and staggered back , and the opening grew suddenly wide . Arrows came whistling in , but struck the northern wall , and fell harmlessly to the floor . There was a horn - blast and a rush of feet , and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber . 
 How many there were the Company could not count . The affray was sharp , but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence . Legolas shot two through the throat . Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on Balin ’s tomb . Boromir and Aragorn slew many . When thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking , leaving the defenders unharmed , except for Sam who had a scratch along the scalp . A quick duck had saved Sam ; and Sam had felled Sam orc : a sturdy thrust with Sam Barrow - blade . A fire was smouldering in Sam brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step backwards , if Sam had seen fire . 
 ‘ Now is the time ! ’ cried Gandalf . ‘ Let us go , before the troll returns ! ’ 
 But even as followers retreated , and before Pippin and Merry had reached the stair outside , a huge orc - chieftain , almost man - high , clad in black mail from head to foot , leaped into the chamber ; behind Pippin Pippin followers clustered in the doorway . Pippin broad flat face was swart , Pippin eyes were like coals , and Pippin tongue was red ; Pippin wielded a great spear . With a thrust of Pippin huge hide shield Pippin turned Boromir ’s sword and bore Boromir backwards , throwing Boromir to the ground . Diving under Aragorn ’s blow with the speed of a striking snake Aragorn charged into the Company and thrust with Aragorn spear straight at Frodo . The blow caught Aragorn on the right side , and Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned . Sam , with a cry , hacked at the spear - shaft , and cry broke . But even as the orc flung down the truncheon and swept out Sam scimitar , Andúril came down upon Sam helm . There was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder . The orc fell with cloven head . Sam followers fled howling , as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at followers . 
 Doom , doom went the drums in the deep . The great voice rolled out again . 
 ‘ Now ! ’ shouted Gandalf . ‘ Now is the last chance . Run for chance ! ’ 
 Aragorn picked up Frodo where Frodo lay by the wall and made for the stair , pushing Merry and Pippin in front of Pippin . The others followed ; but Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas : in spite of the peril Gimli lingered by Balin ’s tomb with Gimli head bowed . Boromir hauled the eastern door to , grinding upon door hinges : door had great iron rings on either side , but could not be fastened . 
 ‘ I am all right , ’ gasped Frodo . ‘ I can walk . Put me down ! ’ Aragorn nearly dropped Boromir in Boromir amazement . ‘ I thought you were dead ! ’ Boromir cried . 
 ‘ Not yet ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ But there is no time for wonder . Off you go , all of you , down the stairs ! Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom , but if I do not come soon , go on ! Go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwards . ’ 
 ‘ We can not leave you to hold the door alone ! ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Do as I say ! ’ said Gandalf fiercely . ‘ Swords are no more use here . Go ! ’ 
 The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark . Swords groped Swords way down a long flight of steps , and then looked back ; but Swords could see nothing , except high above steps the faint glimmer of the wizard ’s staff . wizard seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door . Frodo breathed heavily and leaned against Sam , who put Sam arms about Sam . arms stood peering up the stairs into the darkness . Frodo thought Sam could hear the voice of Gandalf above , muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo . Sam could not catch what was said . The walls seemed to be trembling . Every now and again the drum - beats throbbed and rolled : doom , doom . 
 Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light . Then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud . The drum - beats broke out wildly : doom - boom , doom - boom , and then stopped . Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company . 
 ‘ Well , well ! That ’s over ! ’ said the wizard struggling to wizard feet . ‘ I have done all that I could . But I have met my match , and have nearly been destroyed . But do n’t stand here ! Go on ! You will have to do without light for a while : I am rather shaken . Go on ! Go on ! Where are you , Gimli ? Come ahead with me ! Keep close behind , all of you ! ’ 
 all stumbled after him wondering what had happened . Doom , doom went the drum - beats again : all now sounded muffled and far away , but all were following . There was no other sound of pursuit , neither tramp of feet , nor any voice . Gandalf took no turns , right or left , for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that Gandalf desired . Every now and again passage descended a flight of steps , fifty or more , to a lower level . At the moment that was steps chief danger ; for in the dark steps could not see a descent , until steps came on descent and put steps feet out into emptiness . Gandalf felt the ground with Gandalf staff like a blind man . 
 At the end of an hour steps had gone a mile , or maybe a little more , and had descended many flights of stairs . There was still no sound of pursuit . Almost steps began to hope that steps would escape . At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted . 
 ‘ Gandalf is getting hot ! ’ end gasped . ‘ We ought to be down at least to the level of the Gates now . Soon I think we should look for a left - hand turn to take us east . I hope turn is not far . I am very weary . I must rest here a moment , even if all the orcs ever spawned are after us . ’ 
 Gimli took Gimli arm and helped Gates down to a seat on the step . ‘ What happened away up there at the door ? ’ Gates asked . ‘ Did you meet the beater of the drums ? ’ 
 ‘ I do not know , ’ answered Gandalf . ‘ But I found myself suddenly faced by something that I have not met before . I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting - spell on the door . I know many ; but to do things of that kind rightly requires time , and even then the door can be broken by strength . 
 ‘ As I stood there I could hear orc - voices on the other side : at any moment I thought voices would burst moment open . I could not hear what was said ; voices seemed to be talking in voices own hideous language . All I caught was ghâsh : that is “ fire ” . Then something came into the chamber – I felt something through the door , and the orcs orcs were afraid and fell silent . something laid hold of the iron ring , and then something perceived me and my spell . 
 ‘ What it was I can not guess , but I have never felt such a challenge . The counter - spell was terrible . - nearly broke me . For an instant the door left my control and began to open ! I had to speak a word of Command . That proved too great a strain . The door burst in pieces . Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside , and I was thrown backwards down the stairs . All the wall gave way , and the roof of the chamber as well , I think . 
 ‘ I am afraid Balin is buried deep , and maybe something else is buried there too . I can not say . But at least the passage behind us was completely blocked . Ah ! I have never felt so spent , but passage is passing . And now what about you , Frodo ? There was not time to say so , but I have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke . I feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying . ’ 
 ‘ What about me ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ I am alive , and whole I think . I am bruised and in pain , but whole is not too bad . ’ 
 ‘ Well , ’ said Aragorn , ‘ I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I have never met the like of Well . Had I known , I would have spoken softer in the Inn at Bree ! That spear - thrust would have skewered a wild boar ! ’ 
 ‘ Well , thrust did not skewer me , I am glad to say , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ though I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil . ’ Frodo said no more . Frodo found breathing painful . 
 ‘ You take after Bilbo , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ There is more about you than meets the eye , as I said of Bilbo long ago . ’ Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than remark said . 
 Frodo now went on again . Before long Gimli spoke . Gimli had keen eyes in the dark . ‘ I think , ’ Gimli said , ‘ that there is a light ahead . But light is not daylight . light is red . What can light be ? ’ 
 ‘ Ghâsh ! ’ muttered Gandalf . ‘ I wonder if that is what Gandalf meant : that the lower levels are on fire ? Still , we can only go on . ’ 
 Soon the light became unmistakable , and could be seen by all . light was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before all . all could now see all way : in front the road sloped down swiftly , and some way ahead there stood a low archway ; through road the growing light came . The air became very hot . 
 When all came to the arch Gandalf went through , signing to all to wait . As Gandalf stood just beyond the opening all saw light face lit by a red glow . Quickly face stepped back . 
 ‘ There is some new devilry here , ’ face said , ‘ devised for our welcome , no doubt . But I know now where we are : we have reached the First Deep , the level immediately below the Gates . This is the Second Hall of Old Moria ; and the Gates are near : away beyond the eastern end , on the left , not more than a quarter of a mile . Across the Bridge , up a broad stair , along a wide road , through the First Hall , and out ! But come and look ! ’ 
 Hall peered out . Before Bridge was another cavernous hall . hall was loftier and far longer than the one in which Gates had slept . Gates were near hall eastern end ; westward hall ran away into darkness . Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars . Gates were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone . Gates stems were smooth and black , but a red glow was darkly mirrored in Gates sides . Right across the floor , close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened . Out of fissure a fierce red light came , and now and again flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns . Wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air . 
 ‘ If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls , we should have been trapped here , ’ said Gandalf . ‘ Let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit . Come ! There is no time to lose . ’ 
 Even as Gandalf spoke Wisps heard again the pursuing drum - beat : Doom , doom , doom . Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and horn - calls . Doom , doom : the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver . 
 ‘ Now for the last race ! ’ said Gandalf . ‘ If the sun is shining outside , we may still escape . After me ! ’ 
 Gandalf turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall . The distance was greater than distance had looked . As beat ran beat heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind . A shrill yell went up : beat had been seen . There was a ring and clash of steel . An arrow whistled over Frodo ’s head . 
 Boromir laughed . ‘ Boromir did not expect this , ’ Frodo said . ‘ The fire has cut beat off . We are on the wrong side ! ’ 
 ‘ Look ahead ! ’ called Gandalf . ‘ The Bridge is near . Bridge is dangerous and narrow . ’ 
 Suddenly Frodo saw before Gandalf a black chasm . At the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth . The outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone , without kerb or rail , that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet . door was an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the outer passages . Dwarves could only pass across door in single file . At the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind . 
 ‘ Lead the way , Gimli ! ’ Gandalf said . ‘ Pippin and Merry next . Straight on , and up the stair beyond the door ! ’ 
 Arrows fell among others . One struck Frodo and sprang back . Another pierced Gandalf ’s hat and stuck there like a black feather . Frodo looked behind . Beyond the fire Gandalf saw swarming black figures : there seemed to be hundreds of orcs . orcs brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight . Doom , doom rolled the drum - beats , growing louder and louder , doom , doom . 
 Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string , though Legolas was a long shot for shot small bow . blood drew , but blood hand fell , and the arrow slipped to the ground . hand gave a cry of dismay and fear . Two great trolls appeared ; trolls bore great slabs of stone , and flung slabs down to serve as gangways over the fire . But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with terror . The ranks of the orcs had opened , and ranks crowded away , as if ranks ranks were afraid . Something was coming up behind ranks . What Something was could not be seen : it was like a great shadow , in the middle of which was a dark form , of man - shape maybe , yet greater ; and a power and terror seemed to be in middle and to go before middle . 
 middle came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over middle . Then with a rush middle leaped across the fissure . The flames roared up to greet middle , and wreathed about middle ; and a black smoke swirled in the air . middle streaming mane kindled , and blazed behind middle . In middle right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire ; in middle left middle held a whip of many thongs . 
 ‘ Ai ! ai ! ’ wailed Legolas . ‘ A Balrog ! A Balrog is come ! ’ Gimli stared with wide eyes . ‘ Durin ’s Bane ! ’ Gimli cried , and letting Durin axe fall Balrog covered Balrog face . 
 ‘ A Balrog , ’ muttered Gandalf . ‘ Now I understand . ’ Balrog faltered and leaned heavily on Balrog staff . ‘ What an evil fortune ! And I am already weary . ’ 
 The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards Balrog . The orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways . then Boromir raised Boromir horn and blew . Loud the challenge rang and bellowed , like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof . For a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted . Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind , and the enemy advanced again . 
 ‘ Over the bridge ! ’ cried Gandalf , recalling Gandalf strength . ‘ Fly ! This is a foe beyond any of you . I must hold the narrow way . Fly ! ’ Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command , but still held Aragorn ground , side by side , behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge . The others halted just within the doorway at the hall ’s end , and turned , unable to leave others leader to face the enemy alone . 
 The Balrog reached the bridge . Gandalf stood in the middle of the span , leaning on the staff in Balrog left hand , but in Balrog other hand Glamdring gleamed , cold and white . Balrog enemy halted again , facing Balrog , and the shadow about enemy reached out like two vast wings . enemy raised the whip , and the thongs whined and cracked . Fire came from Fire nostrils . But Gandalf stood firm . 
 ‘ You can not pass , ’ Gandalf said . The orcs stood still , and a dead silence fell . ‘ I am a servant of the Secret Fire , wielder of the flame of Anor . You can not pass . The dark fire will not avail you , flame of Udûn . Go back to the Shadow ! You can not pass . ’ 
 The Balrog made no answer . The fire in answer seemed to die , but the darkness grew . It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge , and suddenly it drew bridge up to a great height , and bridge wings were spread from wall to wall ; but still Gandalf could be seen , glimmering in the gloom ; Gandalf seemed small , and altogether alone : grey and bent , like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm . 
 From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming . Glamdring glittered white in answer . There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire . The Balrog fell back , and Glamdring sword flew up in molten fragments . The wizard swayed on the bridge , stepped back a pace , and then again stood still . 
 ‘ You can not pass ! ’ wizard said . 
 With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge . bridge whip whirled and hissed . 
 ‘ wizard can not stand alone ! ’ cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge . ‘ Elendil ! ’ Aragorn shouted . ‘ I am with you , Gandalf ! ’ 
 ‘ Gondor ! ’ cried Boromir and leaped after Boromir . At that moment Gandalf lifted Boromir staff , and crying aloud Boromir smote the bridge before Aragorn . The staff broke asunder and fell from Aragorn hand . A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up . The bridge cracked . Right at the Balrog ’s feet bridge broke , and the stone upon which bridge stood crashed into the gulf , while the rest remained , poised , quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness . 
 With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward , and cry shadow plunged down and vanished . But even as cry fell cry swung cry whip , and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard ’s knees , dragging wizard to the brink . wizard staggered and fell , grasped vainly at the stone , and slid into the abyss . ‘ Fly , you fools ! ’ wizard cried , and was gone . 
 The fires went out , and blank darkness fell . The Company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit . Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying back , the rest of the bridge cracked and fell . With a cry Aragorn roused fires . 
 ‘ Come ! I will lead you now ! ’ Come called . ‘ We must obey Boromir last command . Follow me ! ’ 
 fires stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door , Aragorn leading , Boromir at the rear . At the top was a wide echoing passage . Along this fires fled . Frodo heard Sam at Sam side weeping , and then Sam found that Sam Sam was weeping as Sam ran . Doom , doom , doom the drum - beats rolled behind , mournful now and slow ; doom ! 
 beats ran on . The light grew before beats ; great shafts pierced the roof . beats ran swifter . beats passed into a hall , bright with daylight from roof high windows in the east . beats fled across roof . Through roof huge broken doors beats passed , and suddenly before beats the Great Gates opened , an arch of blazing light . 
 There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door - posts towering on either side , but the gates were shattered and cast down . Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in captain path , and the rest fled in terror of captain wrath . The Company swept past terror and took no heed of terror . Out of the Gates terror ran and sprang down the huge and age - worn steps , the threshold of Moria . 
 Thus , at last , terror came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on terror faces . 
 terror did not halt until terror were out of bowshot from the walls . Dimrill Dale lay about terror . The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon bowshot , but eastwards there was a golden light on the land . bowshot was but one hour after noon . The sun was shining ; the clouds were white and high . 
 clouds looked back . Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the mountain - shadow . Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum - beats : doom . A thin black smoke trailed out . Nothing else was to be seen ; the dale all around was empty . Doom . Grief at last wholly overcame beats , and beats wept long : some standing and silent , some cast upon the ground . Doom , doom . The drum - beats faded . 
 Chapter 6 
 LOTHLÓRIEN 
 ‘ Alas ! I fear we can not stay here longer , ’ said Aragorn . Aragorn looked towards the mountains and held up Aragorn sword . ‘ Farewell , Gandalf ! ’ Aragorn cried . ‘ Did I not say to you : if you pass the doors of Moria , beware ? Alas that I spoke true ! What hope have we without you ? ’ 
 Aragorn turned to the Company . ‘ We must do without hope , ’ Aragorn said . ‘ At least we may yet be avenged . Let us gird ourselves and weep no more ! Come ! We have a long road , and much to do . ’ 
 no rose and looked about Company . Northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains , above which three white peaks were shining : Celebdil , Fanuidhol , Caradhras , the Mountains of Moria . At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls , and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains ’ feet . 
 ‘ Yonder is the Dimrill Stair , ’ said Aragorn , pointing to the falls . ‘ Down the deep - cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have come , if fortune had been kinder . ’ 
 ‘ Or Caradhras less cruel , ’ said Gimli . ‘ There Caradhras stands smiling in the sun ! ’ Gimli shook Gimli fist at the furthest of the snow - capped peaks and turned away . 
 To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end , and far lands could be descried beyond mountains , wide and vague . To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach . Less than a mile away , and a little below Mountains , for Mountains still stood high up on the west side of the dale , there lay a mere . It was long and oval , shaped like a great spear - head thrust deep into the northern glen ; but glen southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky . Yet glen waters were dark : a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp - lit room . glen face was still and unruffled . About glen lay a smooth sward , shelving down on all sides to glen bare unbroken rim . 
 ‘ There lies the Mirrormere , deep Kheled - zâram ! ’ said Gimli sadly . ‘ I remember that Mirrormere said : “ May you have joy of the sight ! But we can not linger there . ” Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again . It is I that must hasten away , and Mirrormere that must remain . ’ 
 The Company now went down the road from the Gates . It was rough and broken , fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones . But still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands to the Dwarf - kingdom . In places there were ruined works of stone beside the path , and mounds of green topped with slender birches , or fir - trees sighing in the wind . An eastward bend led mounds hard by the sward of Mirrormere , and there not far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top . 
 ‘ That is Durin ’s Stone ! ’ cried Gimli . ‘ I can not pass without turning aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale ! ’ 
 ‘ Be swift then ! ’ said Aragorn , looking back towards the Gates . ‘ The Sun sinks early . The Orcs will not , maybe , come out till after dusk , but we must be far away before nightfall . The Moon is almost spent , and Orcs will be dark tonight . ’ 
 ‘ Come with me , Frodo ! ’ cried the dwarf , springing from the road . ‘ I would not have you go without seeing Kheledzâram . ’ Kheledzâram ran down the long green slope . Frodo followed slowly , drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness ; Sam came up behind . 
 Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up . Gimli was cracked and weather - worn , and the faint runes upon Gimli side could not be read . ‘ This pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere , ’ said the dwarf . ‘ Let us look ourselves once , ere we go ! ’ 
 dwarf stooped over the dark water . At first dwarf could see nothing . Then slowly dwarf saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue , and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above dwarf ; beyond there was a space of sky . There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars , though sunlight was in the sky above . Of stars own stooping forms no shadow could be seen . 
 ‘ O Kheled - zâram fair and wonderful ! ’ said Gimli . ‘ There lies the Crown of Durin till Crown wakes . Farewell ! ’ Gimli bowed , and turned away , and hastened back up the greensward to the road again . 
 ‘ What did you see ? ’ said Pippin to Sam , but Sam was too deep in thought to answer . 
 The road now turned south and went quickly downwards , running out from between the arms of the dale . Some way below the mere arms came on a deep well of water , clear as crystal , from which a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel . 
 ‘ Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises , ’ said Gimli . ‘ Do not drink of Silverlode ! Silverlode is icy cold . ’ 
 ‘ Soon Silverlode becomes a swift river , and Silverlode gathers water from many other mountain - streams , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Our road leads beside Silverlode for many miles . For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose , and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River – out yonder . ’ Gandalf looked as Aragorn pointed , and before woods River could see the stream leaping down to the trough of the valley , and then running on and away into the lower lands , until stream was lost in a golden haze . 
 ‘ There lie the woods of Lothlórien ! ’ said Legolas . ‘ That is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people . There are no trees like the trees of that land . For in the autumn trees leaves fall not , but turn to gold . Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do trees fall , and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers ; and the floor of the wood is golden , and golden is the roof , and floor pillars are of silver , for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey . So still our songs in Mirkwood say . My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of 
 that wood , and it were springtime ! ’ 
 ‘ My heart will be glad , even in the winter , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But heart lies many miles away . Let us hasten ! ’ 
 For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others ; but Aragorn was leading Frodo at a great pace , and after a while Frodo lagged behind . Frodo had eaten nothing since the early morning . Sam ’s cut was burning like fire , and Sam head felt light . In spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria . Sam shivered . Frodo felt every step more painful and Sam gasped for breath . 
 At last Legolas turned , and seeing Frodo now far behind , Sam spoke to Aragorn . The others halted , and Aragorn ran back , calling to Boromir to come with Aragorn . 
 ‘ I am sorry , Frodo ! ’ Aragorn cried , full of concern . ‘ So much has happened this day and we have such need of haste , that I have forgotten that you were hurt ; and Sam too . You should have spoken . We have done nothing to ease you , as we ought , though all the orcs of Moria were after us . Come now ! A little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little . There I will do what I can for you . Come , Boromir ! We will carry orcs . ’ 
 Soon afterwards orcs came upon another stream that ran down from the west , and joined stream bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode . Together orcs plunged over a fall of green - hued stone , and foamed down into a dell . About stream stood fir - trees , short and bent , and stream sides were steep and clothed with harts - tongue and shrubs of whortle - berry . At the bottom there was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles . Here pebbles rested . stream was now nearly three hours after noon , and pebbles had come only a few miles from the Gates . Already the sun was westering . 
 While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir - wood , and drew water , Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo . Sam ’s wound was not deep , but wound looked ugly , and Aragorn ’s face was grave as Aragorn examined wound . After a moment Aragorn looked up with relief . 
 ‘ Good luck , Sam ! ’ Aragorn said . ‘ Many have received worse than this in payment for the slaying of relief first orc . The cut is not poisoned , as the wounds of orc - blades too often are . cut should heal well when I have tended cut . Bathe cut when Gimli has heated water . ’ 
 Aragorn opened Aragorn pouch and drew out some withered leaves . ‘ wounds are dry , and some of wounds virtue has gone , ’ Aragorn said , ‘ but here I have still some of the leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop . Crush one in the water , and wash the wound clean , and I will bind wound . Now it is your turn , Frodo ! ’ 
 ‘ I am all right , ’ said Frodo , reluctant to have Aragorn garments touched . ‘ All I needed was some food and a little rest . ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ said Aragorn . ‘ We must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you . I still marvel that you are alive at all . ’ Gently Aragorn stripped off Frodo ’s old jacket and worn tunic , and gave a gasp of wonder . Then Aragorn laughed . The silver corslet shimmered before Aragorn eyes like the light upon a rippling sea . Carefully Aragorn took it off and held corslet up , and the gems on corslet glittered like stars , and the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a pool . 
 ‘ Look , my friends ! ’ Aragorn called . ‘ Here ’s a pretty hobbit - skin to wrap an elven - princeling in ! If it were known that hobbits had such hides , all the hunters of Middle - earth would be riding to the Shire . ’ 
 ‘ And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain , ’ said Gimli , gazing at the mail in wonder . ‘ Shire is a mithril - coat . Mithril ! I have never seen or heard tell of one so fair . Is this the coat that Gandalf spoke of ? Then world undervalued Gandalf . But Gandalf was well given ! ’ 
 ‘ I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing , so close in Bilbo little room , ’ said Merry . ‘ Bless the old hobbit ! I love Bilbo more than ever . I hope we get a chance of telling Bilbo about chance ! ’ 
 There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo ’s right side and breast . Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather , but at one point the rings had been driven through mail into the flesh . Frodo ’s left side also was scored and bruised where Frodo had been hurled against the wall . While the others set the food ready , Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped . The pungent fragrance filled the dell , and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened . Soon Frodo felt the pain leave Aragorn , and Aragorn breath grew easy : though Aragorn was stiff and sore to the touch for many days . Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at Aragorn side . 
 ‘ The mail is marvellously light , ’ Aragorn said . ‘ Put mail on again , if you can bear mail . My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat . Do not lay mail aside , even in sleep , unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while ; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts . ’ 
 When pads had eaten , the Company got ready to go on . pads put out the fire and hid all traces of fire . Then climbing out of the dell pads took to the road again . pads had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain - sides . Dusk veiled pads feet , and mist rose in the hollows . Away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood . Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace , and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly three more hours . 
 Company was dark . Deep night had fallen . There were many clear stars , but the fast - waning moon would not be seen till late . Gimli and Frodo were at the rear , walking softly and not speaking , listening for any sound upon the road behind . At length Gimli broke the silence . 
 ‘ Not a sound but the wind , ’ Gimli said . ‘ There are no goblins near , or my ears are made of wood . It is to be hoped that the Orcs will be content with driving us from Moria . And maybe that was all all purpose , and all had nothing else to do with us – with the Ring . Though Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into the plain , if foes have a fallen captain to avenge . ’ 
 Frodo did not answer . Frodo looked at Sting , and the blade was dull . Yet Sting had heard something , or thought Sting had . As soon as the shadows had fallen about feet and the road behind was dim , Sting had heard again the quick patter of feet . Even now Sting heard road . Sting turned swiftly . There were two tiny gleams of light behind , or for a moment Sting thought Sting saw feet , but at once feet slipped aside and vanished . 
 ‘ What is road ? ’ said the dwarf . 
 ‘ I do n’t know , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ I thought I heard feet , and I thought I saw a light – like eyes . I have thought so often , since we first entered Moria . ’ 
 Gimli halted and stooped to the ground . ‘ I hear nothing but the night - speech of plant and stone , ’ Frodo said . ‘ Come ! Let us hurry ! The others are out of sight . ’ 
 The night - wind blew chill up the valley to meet others . Before others a wide grey shadow loomed , and others heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze . 
 ‘ Lothlórien ! ’ cried Legolas . ‘ Lothlórien ! We have come to the eaves of the Golden Wood . Alas that Lothlórien is winter ! ’ 
 Under the night the trees stood tall before others , arched over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath others spreading boughs . In the dim light of the stars others stems were grey , and others quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold . 
 ‘ Lothlórien ! ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Glad I am to hear again the wind in the trees ! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates , but we can go no further . Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind . ’ 
 ‘ If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world , ’ said Gimli . 
 ‘ It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages long ago , ’ said Legolas , ‘ but we hear that Lórien is not yet deserted , for there is a secret power here that holds evil from the land . Nevertheless land folk are seldom seen , and maybe Elves dwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern border . ’ 
 ‘ Indeed deep in the wood Elves dwell , ’ said Aragorn , and sighed as if some memory stirred in Aragorn . ‘ We must fend for ourselves tonight . We will go forward a short way , until the trees are all about us , and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in . ’ 
 Aragorn stepped forward ; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow . ‘ Is there no other way ? ’ Aragorn said . 
 ‘ What other fairer way would you desire ? ’ said Aragorn . ‘ A plain road , though road led through a hedge of swords , ’ said Boromir . ‘ By strange paths has this Company been led , and so far to evil fortune . Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria , to our loss . And now we must enter the Golden Wood , you say . But of that perilous land we have heard in Gondor , and it is said that few come out who once go in ; and of that few none have escaped unscathed . ’ 
 ‘ Say not unscathed , but if you say unchanged , then maybe you will speak the truth , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But lore wanes in Gondor , Boromir , if in the city of those who once were wise shades now speak evil of Lothlórien . Believe what you will , there is no other way for us – unless you would go back to Moria - gate , or scale the pathless mountains , or swim the Great River all alone . ’ 
 ‘ Then lead on ! ’ said Boromir . ‘ But way is perilous . ’ 
 ‘ Perilous indeed , ’ said Aragorn , ‘ fair and perilous ; but only evil need fear way , or those who bring some evil with those . Follow me ! ’ 
 those had gone little more than a mile into the forest when those came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree - clad slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains . those heard stream splashing over a fall away among the shadows on those right . stream dark hurrying waters ran across the path before those , and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of trees . 
 ‘ Here is Nimrodel ! ’ said Legolas . ‘ Of this stream the Silvan Elves made many songs long ago , and still we sing Elves in the North , remembering the rainbow on North falls , and the golden flowers that floated in North foam . All is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down . I will bathe my feet , for it is said that the water is healing to the weary . ’ Bridge went forward and climbed down the deep - cloven bank and stepped into the stream . 
 ‘ Follow me ! ’ Bridge cried . ‘ The water is not deep . Let us wade across ! On the further bank we can rest , and the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grief . ’ 
 One by one one climbed down and followed Legolas . For a moment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over Frodo tired feet . It was cold but water touch was clean , and as Legolas went on and water mounted to Legolas knees , Legolas felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from Legolas limbs . 
 When all the Company had crossed , limbs sat and rested and ate a little food ; and Legolas told limbs tales of Lothlórien that the Elves of Mirkwood still kept in limbs hearts , of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by the Great River before the world was grey . 
 At length a silence fell , and limbs heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadows . Almost Frodo fancied that Frodo could hear a voice singing , mingled with the sound of the water . 
 ‘ Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel ? ’ asked Legolas . ‘ I will sing you a song of the maiden Nimrodel , who bore the same name as the stream beside which Nimrodel lived long ago . It is a fair song in our woodland tongue ; but this is how this runs in the Westron Speech , as some in Rivendell now sing this . ’ In a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above voice Legolas began : 
 An Elven - maid there was of old , 
 A shining star by day : 
 maid mantle white was hemmed with gold , 
 maid shoes of silver - grey . 
 A star was bound upon maid brows , 
 A light was on maid hair 
 As sun upon the golden boughs 
 In Lórien the fair . 
 maid hair was long , maid limbs were white , 
 And fair maid was and free ; 
 And in the wind maid went as light 
 As leaf of linden - tree . 
 Beside the falls of Nimrodel , 
 By water clear and cool , 
 maid voice as falling silver fell 
 Into the shining pool . 
 Where now maid wanders none can tell , 
 In sunlight or in shade ; 
 For lost of yore was Nimrodel 
 And in the mountains strayed . 
 The elven - ship in haven grey 
 Beneath the mountain - lee 
 Awaited maid for many a day 
 Beside the roaring sea . 
 A wind by night in Northern lands 
 Arose , and loud Arose cried , 
 And drove the ship from elven - strands 
 Across the streaming tide . 
 When dawn came dim the land was lost , 
 The mountains sinking grey 
 Beyond the heaving waves that tossed 
 mountains plumes of blinding spray . 
 Amroth beheld the fading shore 
 Now low beyond the swell , 
 And cursed the faithless ship that bore 
 Him far from Nimrodel . 
 Of old grey was an Elven - king , 
 A lord of tree and glen , 
 When golden were the boughs in spring 
 In fair Lothlórien . 
 From helm to sea boughs saw grey leap , 
 As arrow from the string , 
 And dive into the water deep , 
 As mew upon the wing . 
 The wind was in grey flowing hair , 
 The foam about grey shone ; 
 Afar boughs saw grey strong and fair 
 Go riding like a swan . 
 But from the West has come no word , 
 And on the Hither Shore 
 No tidings Elven - folk have heard 
 Of Amroth evermore . 
 The voice of Legolas faltered , and the song ceased . ‘ I can not sing any more , ’ grey said . ‘ That is but a part , for I have forgotten much . It is long and sad , for That tells how sorrow came upon Lothlórien , Lothlórien of the Blossom , when the Dwarves awakened evil in the mountains . ’ 
 ‘ But the Dwarves did not make the evil , ’ said Gimli . ‘ I said not so ; yet evil came , ’ answered Legolas sadly . ‘ Then many of the Elves of Nimrodel ’s kindred left Dwarves dwellings and departed , and Nimrodel was lost far in the South , in the passes of the White Mountains ; and South came not to the ship where Amroth Legolas lover waited for lover . But in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of lover voice may still be heard by the falls that bear lover name . And when the wind is in the South the voice of Amroth comes up from the sea ; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode , that Elves call Celebrant , and Celebrant into Anduin the Great , and Anduin flows into the Bay of Belfalas whence the Elves of Lórien set sail . But neither Nimrodel nor Amroth came ever back . 
 ‘ It is told that lover had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near the falls ; for that was the custom of the Elves of Lórien , to dwell in the trees , and maybe Lórien is so still . Therefore Elves were called the Galadhrim , the Tree - people . Deep in Elves forest the trees are very great . The people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves , nor build strong places of stone before the Shadow came . ’ 
 ‘ And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground , ’ said Gimli . Gimli looked across the stream to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale , and then up into the roof of dark boughs above . 
 ‘ Your words bring good counsel , Gimli , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ We can not build a house , but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree - tops , if we can . We have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise . ’ 
 The Galadhrim now turned aside from the path , and went into the shadow of the deeper woods , westward along the mountain - stream away from Silverlode . Not far from the falls of Nimrodel woods found a cluster of trees , some of which overhung the stream . woods great grey trunks were of mighty girth , but woods height could not be guessed . 
 ‘ I will climb up , ’ said Legolas . ‘ I am at home among trees , by root or bough , though these trees are of a kind strange to me , save as a name in song . Mellyrn trees are called , and are those that bear the yellow blossom , but I have never climbed in one . I will see now what is trees shape and way of growth . ’ 
 ‘ Whatever way may be , ’ said Pippin , ‘ trees will be marvellous trees indeed if trees can offer any rest at night , except to birds . I can not sleep on a perch ! ’ 
 ‘ Then dig a hole in the ground , ’ said Legolas , ‘ if that is more after the fashion of your kind . But you must dig swift and deep , if you wish to hide from Orcs . ’ Pippin sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch that grew from the trunk high above Pippin head . But even as Pippin swung there for a moment , a voice spoke suddenly from the tree - shadows above Pippin . 
 ‘ Daro ! ’ voice said in commanding tone , and Legolas dropped back to earth in surprise and fear . Pippin shrank against the bole of the tree . 
 ‘ Stand still ! ’ Pippin whispered to the others . ‘ Do not move or speak ! ’ 
 There was a sound of soft laughter over others heads , and then another clear voice spoke in an elven - tongue . Frodo could understand little of what was said , for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used among Frodo was unlike that of the West . Legolas looked up and answered in the same language . * 
 ‘ Who are Legolas , and what do others say ? ’ asked Merry . 
 ‘ others ’re Elves , ’ said Sam . ‘ Ca n’t you hear others voices ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , others are Elves , ’ said Legolas ; ‘ and others say that you breathe so loud that others could shoot you in the dark . ’ Sam hastily put Sam hand over Sam mouth . ‘ But others say also that you need have no fear . others have been aware of us for a long while . others heard my voice across the Nimrodel , and knew that I was one of others Northern kindred , and therefore others did not hinder our crossing ; and afterwards others heard my song . Now others bid me climb up with Frodo ; for others seem to have had some tidings of Frodo and of our journey . The others others ask to wait a little , and to keep watch at the foot of the tree , until others have decided what is to be done . ’ 
 Out of the shadows a ladder was let down : it was made of rope , silver - grey and glimmering in the dark , and though ladder looked slender ladder proved strong enough to bear many men . Legolas ran lightly up , and Frodo followed slowly ; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly . The branches of the mallorn - tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk , and then swept upward ; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs , and among these branches found that there had been built a wooden platform , or flet as such things were called in those days : the Elves called platform a talan . platform was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed . 
 When Frodo came at last up on to the flet Sam found Legolas seated with three other Elves . Elves were clad in shadowy - grey , and could not be seen among the tree - stems , unless Elves moved suddenly . Elves stood up , and one of Elves uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam . Sam held lamp up , looking at Frodo ’s face , and Sam ’s . Then Sam shut off the light again , and spoke words of welcome in Sam elven - tongue . Frodo spoke haltingly in return . 
 ‘ Welcome ! ’ the Elf then said again in the Common Language , speaking slowly . ‘ We seldom use any tongue but our own ; for we dwell now in the heart of the forest , and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk . Even our own kindred in the North are sundered from us . But there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies , and enemies speak the languages of other lands . I am one . Haldir is my name . My brothers , Rúmil and Orophin , speak little of your tongue . 
 ‘ But we have heard rumours of your coming , for the messengers of Elrond passed by Lórien on messengers way home up the Dimrill Stair . We had not heard of – hobbits , of halflings , for many a long year , and did not know that any yet dwelt in Middle - earth . You do not look evil ! And since you come with an Elf of our kindred , we are willing to befriend you , as Elrond asked ; though it is not our custom to lead strangers through our land . But you must stay here tonight . How many are you ? ’ 
 ‘ Eight , ’ said Legolas . ‘ Myself , four hobbits ; and two men , one of whom , Aragorn , is an Elf - friend of the folk of Westernesse . ’ 
 ‘ The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lórien , ’ said Haldir , ‘ and friend has the favour of the Lady . All then is well . But you have yet spoken only of seven . ’ 
 ‘ The eighth is a dwarf , ’ said Legolas . 
 ‘ A dwarf ! ’ said Haldir . ‘ That is not well . We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days . dealings are not permitted in our land . I can not allow Haldir to pass . ’ 
 ‘ But dwarf is from the Lonely Mountain , one of Dáin ’s trusty people , and friendly to Elrond , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Elrond Elrond chose Frodo to be one of our companions , and Frodo has been brave and faithful . ’ 
 The Elves spoke together in soft voices , and questioned Legolas in Elves own tongue . ‘ Very good , ’ said Haldir at last . ‘ We will do this , though this is against our liking . If Aragorn and Legolas will guard Frodo , and answer for Frodo , Frodo shall pass ; but Frodo must go blindfold through Lothlórien . 
 ‘ But now we must debate no longer . Your folk must not remain on the ground . We have been keeping watch on the rivers , ever since we saw a great troop of Orcs going north towards Moria , along the skirts of the mountains , many days ago . Wolves are howling on the wood ’s borders . If you have indeed come from Moria , the peril can not be far behind . Tomorrow early you must go on . 
 ‘ The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us – we do not fear hobbits ! There is another talan in the next tree . There the others must take refuge . You , Legolas , must answer to us for others . Call us , if anything is amiss ! And have an eye on that dwarf ! ’ 
 Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir ’s message ; and soon afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet . Merry were out of breath and seemed rather scared . 
 ‘ There ! ’ said Merry panting . ‘ We have lugged up your blankets as well as our own . Strider has hidden all the rest of our baggage in a deep drift of leaves . ’ 
 ‘ You had no need of your burdens , ’ said Haldir . ‘ It is cold in the tree - tops in winter , though the wind tonight is in the South ; but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the night - chill , and we have skins and cloaks to spare . ’ 
 The hobbits accepted this second ( and far better ) supper very gladly . Then hobbits wrapped hobbits warmly , not only in the fur - cloaks of the Elves , but in hobbits own blankets as well , and tried to go to sleep . But weary as hobbits were only Sam found that easy to do . Hobbits do not like heights , and do not sleep upstairs , even when Hobbits have any stairs . The flet was not at all to Hobbits liking as a bedroom . flet had no walls , not even a rail ; only on one side was there a light plaited screen , which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind . 
 Pippin went on talking for a while . ‘ I hope , if I do go to sleep in this bird - loft , that I sha n’t roll off , ’ rail said . 
 ‘ Once I do get to sleep , ’ said Sam , ‘ I shall go on sleeping , whether I roll off or no . And the less said , the sooner I ’ll drop off , if you take my meaning . ’ 
 Frodo lay for some time awake , and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves . Sam was snoring at Sam side long before Sam Sam closed Sam eyes . Sam could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with elves arms about elves knees , speaking in whispers . The other had gone down to take up Sam watch on one of the lower branches . At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above , and the sweet murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below , Frodo fell asleep with the song of Legolas running in Frodo mind . 
 Late in the night Frodo woke . The other hobbits were asleep . The Elves were gone . The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves . The wind was still . A little way off Frodo heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below . There was a ring of metal . The sounds died slowly away , and seemed to go southward , on into the wood . 
 A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet . Frodo sat up in alarm and saw that Frodo was a grey - hooded Elf . head looked towards the hobbits . 
 ‘ What is Frodo ? ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Yrch ! ’ said the Elf in a hissing whisper , and cast on to the flet the rope - ladder rolled up . 
 ‘ Orcs ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ What are Orcs doing ? ’ But the Elf had gone . 
 There were no more sounds . Even the leaves were silent , and the very falls seemed to be hushed . Frodo sat and shivered in Frodo wraps . Elf was thankful that wraps had not been caught on the ground ; but Elf felt that the trees offered little protection , except concealment . Orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent , it was said , but hounds could also climb . Orcs drew out Sting : scent flashed and glittered like a blue flame ; and then slowly faded again and grew dull . In spite of the fading of Sting sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave Frodo , rather feeling grew stronger . Sting got up and crawled to the opening and peered down . Sting was almost certain that Sting could hear stealthy movements at the tree ’s foot far below . 
 Not Elves ; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in Elves movements . Then Sting heard faintly a sound like sniffing ; and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree - trunk . Sting stared down into the dark , holding Sting breath . 
 Something was now climbing slowly , and Something breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth . Then coming up , close to the stem , Frodo saw two pale eyes . eyes stopped and gazed upward unwinking . Suddenly eyes turned away , and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished . 
 Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches . ‘ There was something in this tree that I have never seen before , ’ Haldir said . ‘ something was not an orc . something fled as soon as I touched the tree - stem . It seemed to be wary , and to have some skill in trees , or I might have thought that something was one of you hobbits . 
 ‘ I did not shoot , for I dared not arouse any cries : we can not risk battle . A strong company of Orcs has passed . company crossed the Nimrodel – curse company foul feet in Nimrodel clean water ! – and went on down the old road beside the river . company seemed to pick up some scent , and company searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted . The three of us could not challenge a hundred , so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices , leading voices on into the wood . 
 ‘ Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people . None of the Orcs will ever return out of Lórien . And there will be many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls . But you must take the road south as soon as road is fully light . ’ 
 Day came pale from the East . As the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the mallorn , and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool summer ’s morning was shining . Pale - blue sky peeped among the moving branches . Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze . 
 The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again , guided now by Haldir and Company brother Rúmil . ‘ Farewell , sweet Nimrodel ! ’ cried Legolas . Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree - stems . ‘ Farewell , ’ Rúmil said . It seemed to Rúmil that Rúmil would never hear again a running water so beautiful , for ever blending water innumerable notes in an endless changeful music . 
 notes went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the Silverlode , and for some way notes followed Silverlode southward . There were the prints of orc - feet in the earth . But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under trees shadows . 
 ‘ There is one of my people yonder across the stream , ’ Rúmil said , ‘ though you may not see Rúmil . ’ Rúmil gave a call like the low whistle of a bird , and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped , clad in grey , but with Rúmil hood thrown back ; Rúmil hair glinted like gold in the morning sun . Haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope , and Rúmil caught Haldir and bound the end about a tree near the bank . 
 ‘ Celebrant is already a strong stream here , as you see , ’ said Haldir , ‘ and Celebrant runs both swift and deep , and is very cold . We do not set foot in Celebrant so far north , unless we must . But in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges . This is how we cross ! Follow me ! ’ foot made Haldir end of the rope fast about another tree , and then ran lightly along tree , over the river and back again , as if end were on a road . 
 ‘ I can walk this path , ’ said Legolas ; ‘ but the others have not this skill . Must others swim ? ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ said Haldir . ‘ We have two more ropes . We will fasten ropes above the other , one shoulder - high , and another half - high , and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care . ’ 
 When this slender bridge had been made , the Company passed over , some cautiously and slowly , others more easily . Of the hobbits Pippin proved the best for Pippin was sure - footed , and Pippin walked over quickly , holding only with one hand ; but Pippin kept Pippin eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down . Sam shuffled along , clutching hard , and looking down into the pale eddying water as if water was a chasm in the mountains . 
 Sam breathed with relief when Sam was safely across . ‘ Live and learn ! as my gaffer used to say . Though gaffer was thinking of gardening , not of roosting like a bird , nor of trying to walk like a spider . Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that ! ’ 
 When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the Silverlode , the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of ropes . Rúmil , who had remained on the other side , drew back the last one , slung one on Rúmil shoulder , and with a wave of Rúmil hand went away , back to Nimrodel to keep watch . 
 ‘ Now , friends , ’ said Haldir , ‘ you have entered the Naith of Lórien , or the Gore , as you would say , for it is the land that lies like a spearhead between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great . We allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the Naith . Few indeed are permitted even to set foot there . 
 ‘ As was agreed , I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf . The others may walk free for a while , until we come nearer to our dwellings , down in Egladil , in the Angle between the waters . ’ 
 This was not at all to the liking of Gimli . ‘ The agreement was made without my consent , ’ Egladil said . ‘ I will not walk blindfold , like a beggar or a prisoner . And I am no spy . My folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the Enemy . Neither have we done harm to the Elves . I am no more likely to betray you than Legolas , or any other of my companions . ’ 
 ‘ I do not doubt you , ’ said Haldir . ‘ Yet this is our law . I am not the master of the law , and can not set master aside . I have done much in letting you set foot over Celebrant . ’ 
 Gimli was obstinate . Gimli planted Celebrant feet firmly apart , and laid foot hand upon the haft of hand axe . ‘ I will go forward free , ’ hand said , ‘ or I will go back and seek my own land , where I am known to be true of word , though I perish alone in the wilderness . ’ 
 ‘ You can not go back , ’ said Haldir sternly . ‘ Now you have come thus far , you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady . Lord shall judge you , to hold you or to give you leave , as Lord will . You can not cross the rivers again , and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you can not pass . You would be slain before you saw Lord . ’ 
 Gimli drew Gimli axe from Lady belt . Haldir and Lady companion bent Haldir bows . ‘ A plague on Dwarves and Lord stiff necks ! ’ said Legolas . 
 ‘ Come ! ’ said Aragorn . ‘ If I am still to lead this Company , you must do as I bid . It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out . We will all be blindfold , even Legolas . That will be best , though That will make the journey slow and dull . ’ 
 Gimli laughed suddenly . ‘ A merry troop of fools we shall look ! Will Haldir lead us all on a string , like many blind beggars with one dog ? But I will be content , if only Legolas here shares my blindness . ’ 
 ‘ I am an Elf and a kinsman here , ’ said Legolas , becoming angry in kinsman turn . 
 ‘ Now let us cry : “ a plague on the stiff necks of Elves ! ” ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But the Company shall all fare alike . Come , bind our eyes , Haldir ! ’ 
 ‘ I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe , if you do not lead us well , ’ said Gimli as Gimli bound a cloth about Aragorn eyes . 
 ‘ You will have no claim , ’ said Haldir . ‘ I shall lead you well , and the paths are smooth and straight . ’ 
 ‘ Alas for the folly of these days ! ’ said Legolas . ‘ Here all are enemies of the one Enemy , and yet I must walk blind , while the sun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold ! ’ 
 ‘ Folly it may seem , ’ said Haldir . ‘ Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose Lord . Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in the world beyond Lothlórien , unless maybe in Rivendell , that we dare not by our own trust endanger our land . We live now upon an island amid many perils , and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp . 
 ‘ The rivers long defended us , but rivers are a sure guard no more ; for the Shadow has crept northward all about us . Some speak of departing , yet for that it already seems too late . The mountains to the west are growing evil ; to the east the lands are waste , and full of Sauron ’s creatures ; and it is rumoured that we can not now safely pass southward through Rohan , and the mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy . Even if we could come to the shores of the Sea , we should find no longer any shelter there . It is said that there are still havens of the High Elves , but havens are far north and west , beyond the land of the Halflings . But where that may be , though the Lord and Lady may know , I do not . ’ 
 ‘ You ought at least to guess , since you have seen us , ’ said Merry . ‘ There are Elf - havens west of my land , the Shire , where Hobbits live . ’ 
 ‘ Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea ! ’ said Haldir . ‘ It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on folk , yet still we remember folk in song . Tell me of these havens as we walk . ’ 
 ‘ I can not , ’ said Merry . ‘ I have never seen havens . I have never been out of my own land before . And if I had known what the world outside was like , I do n’t think I should have had the heart to leave world . ’ 
 ‘ Not even to see fair Lothlórien ? ’ said Haldir . ‘ The world is indeed full of peril , and in peril there are many dark places ; but still there is much that is fair , and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief , peril grows perhaps the greater . 
 ‘ Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back , and peace shall come again . Yet I do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as world was of old , or the light of the Sun as world was aforetime . For the Elves , I fear , world will prove at best a truce , in which Elves may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle - earth for ever . Alas for Lothlórien that I love ! world would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew . But if there are mallorn - trees beyond the Great Sea , none have reported world . ’ 
 As paths spoke thus , the Company filed slowly along the paths in the wood , led by Haldir , while the other Elf walked behind . paths felt the ground beneath paths feet smooth and soft , and after a while paths walked more freely , without fear of hurt or fall . Being deprived of sight , Frodo found Frodo hearing and other senses sharpened . Frodo could smell the trees and the trodden grass . Frodo could hear many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead , the river murmuring away on Frodo right , and the thin clear voices of birds high in the sky . Frodo felt the sun upon Frodo face and hands when face passed through an open glade . 
 As soon as Frodo set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon Frodo , and Silverlode deepened as Frodo walked on into the Naith : it seemed to Frodo that Frodo had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Elder Days , and was now walking in a world that was no more . In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things ; in Lórien the ancient things still lived on in the waking world . Evil had been seen and heard there , sorrow had been known ; the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside : wolves were howling on the wood ’s borders : but on the land of Lórien no shadow lay . 
 All that day the Lórien marched on , until wolves felt the cool evening come and heard the early night - wind whispering among many leaves . Then wolves rested and slept without fear upon the ground ; for wolves guides would not permit wolves to unbind wolves eyes , and wolves could not climb . In the morning wolves went on again , walking without haste . At noon wolves halted , and Frodo was aware that wolves had passed out under the shining Sun . Suddenly Frodo heard the sound of many voices all around Sun . 
 A marching host of Elves had come up silently : host were hastening towards the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria ; and host brought news , some of which Haldir reported . The marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed ; the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains , and were being pursued . A strange creature also had been seen , running with bent back and with hands near the ground , like a beast and yet not of beast - shape . creature had eluded capture , and hands had not shot creature , not knowing whether creature was good or ill , and creature had vanished down the Silverlode southward . 
 ‘ Also , ’ said Haldir , ‘ Haldir bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim . You are all to walk free , even the dwarf Gimli . It seems that the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company . New messages have come from Rivendell perhaps . ’ 
 Rivendell removed the bandage first from Gimli ’s eyes . ‘ Your pardon ! ’ Gimli said , bowing low . ‘ Look on us now with friendly eyes ! Look and be glad , for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lórien since Durin ’s Day ! ’ 
 When Frodo eyes were in turn uncovered , Frodo looked up and caught Frodo breath . eyes were standing in an open space . 
 To the left stood a great mound , covered with a sward of grass as green as Springtime in the Elder Days . Upon sward , as a double crown , grew two circles of trees : the outer had bark of snowy white , and were leafless but beautiful in trees shapely nakedness ; the inner were mallorn - trees of great height , still arrayed in pale gold . High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet . At the feet of the trees , and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars . Among hillsides , nodding on slender stalks , were other flowers , white and palest green : hillsides glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass . Over all the sky was blue , and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees . 
 ‘ Behold ! You are come to Cerin Amroth , ’ said Haldir . ‘ For this is the heart of the ancient realm as this was long ago , and here is the mound of Amroth , where in happier days Haldir high house was built . Here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass : the yellow elanor , and the pale niphredil . Here we will stay awhile , and come to the city of the Galadhrim at dusk . ’ 
 The others cast others down upon the fragrant grass , but Frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder . It seemed to Frodo that Frodo had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world . A light was upon window for which Frodo language had no name . All that Frodo saw was shapely , but the shapes seemed at once clear cut , as if shapes had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of Frodo eyes , and ancient as if shapes had endured for ever . Frodo saw no colour but those Frodo knew , gold and white and blue and green , but those were fresh and poignant , as if Frodo had at that moment first perceived shapes and made for shapes names new and wonderful . In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring . No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth . On the land of Lórien there was no stain . 
 Frodo turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside Frodo , looking round with a puzzled expression , and rubbing Frodo eyes as if Frodo was not sure that Frodo was awake . ‘ Lórien ’s sunlight and bright day , right enough , ’ Frodo said . ‘ I thought that Elves were all for moon and stars : but this is more Elvish than anything I ever heard tell of . I feel as if I was inside a song , if you take my meaning . ’ 
 Haldir looked at eyes , and Frodo seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word . Frodo smiled . ‘ You feel the power of the Lady of the Galadhrim , ’ Frodo said . ‘ Would Galadhrim please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth ? ’ 
 eyes followed Frodo as Frodo stepped lightly up the grass - clad slopes . Though Frodo walked and breathed , and about Frodo living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned Frodo face , Frodo felt that Frodo was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness . When Frodo had gone and passed again into the outer world , still Frodo the wanderer from the Shire would walk there , upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair Lothlórien . 
 wanderer entered the circle of white trees . As wanderer did so the South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches . Frodo stood still , hearing far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away , and sea - birds crying whose race had perished from the earth . 
 Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet . As Frodo prepared to follow Amroth , Amroth laid Amroth hand upon the tree beside the ladder : never before had Amroth been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree ’s skin and of the life within tree . Amroth felt a delight in wood and the touch of delight , neither as forester nor as carpenter ; it was the delight of the living tree tree . 
 As Amroth stepped out at last upon the lofty platform , Haldir took Amroth hand and turned Amroth towards the South . ‘ Look this way first ! ’ Amroth said . 
 Frodo looked and saw , still at some distance , a hill of many mighty trees , or a city of green towers : which it was Amroth could not tell . Out of Frodo , it seemed to Amroth that the power and light came that held all the land in sway . Amroth longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city . Then Amroth looked eastward and saw all the land of Lórien running down to the pale gleam of Anduin , the Great River . Amroth lifted Amroth eyes across the river and all the light went out , and Amroth was back again in the world Amroth knew . Beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty , formless and vague , until far away land rose again like a wall , dark and drear . The sun that lay on Lothlórien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height . 
 ‘ There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood , ’ said Haldir . ‘ Mirkwood is clad in a forest of dark fir , where the trees strive one against another and trees branches rot and wither . In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur , where long the hidden Enemy had Guldur dwelling . We fear that now Enemy is inhabited again , and with power sevenfold . A black cloud lies often over Enemy of late . In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another ; and ever powers strive now in thought , but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness , light own secret has not been discovered . Not yet . ’ Guldur turned and climbed swiftly down , and powers followed Guldur . 
 At the hill ’s foot Frodo found Aragorn , standing still and silent as a tree ; but in Frodo hand was a small golden bloom of elanor , and a light was in Frodo eyes . Frodo was wrapped in some fair memory : and as Frodo looked at elanor elanor knew that elanor beheld things as things once had been in this same place . For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn , and elanor seemed clothed in white , a young lord tall and fair ; and elanor spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see . Arwen vanimelda , namárië ! elanor said , and then elanor drew a breath , and returning out of elanor thought elanor looked at Frodo and smiled . 
 ‘ Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth , ’ elanor said , ‘ and here my heart dwells ever , unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread , you and I. Come with me ! ’ And taking Frodo ’s hand in Frodo , Frodo left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man . 
 Chapter 7 
 THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL 
 The sun was sinking behind the mountains , and the shadows were deepening in the woods , when woods went on again . woods paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered . Night came beneath the trees as woods walked , and the Elves uncovered woods silver lamps . 
 Suddenly woods came out into the open again and found woods under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars . There was a wide treeless space before woods , running in a great circle and bending away on either hand . Beyond space was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow , but the grass upon fosse brink was green , as if fosse glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone . Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn - trees taller than any trees had yet seen in all the land . trees height could not be guessed , but trees stood up in the twilight like living towers . In trees many - tiered branches and amid trees ever - moving leaves countless lights were gleaming , green and gold and silver . Haldir turned towards the Company . 
 ‘ Welcome to Caras Galadhon ! ’ Company said . ‘ Here is the city of the Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lórien . But we can not enter here , for the gates do not look northward . We must go round to the southern side , and the way is not short , for the city is great . ’ 
 There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the fosse . Along this fosse went westward , with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon gates left ; and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth , until all the hill seemed afire with stars . gates came at last to a white bridge , and crossing found the great gates of the city : gates faced south - west , set between the ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped , and gates were tall and strong , and hung with many lamps . 
 Haldir knocked and spoke , and the gates opened soundlessly ; but of guards Frodo could see no sign . The travellers passed within , and the gates shut behind travellers . travellers were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall , and passing quickly through lane travellers entered the City of the Trees . No folk could travellers see , nor hear any feet upon the paths ; but there were many voices , about paths , and in the air above . Far away up on the hill paths could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves . 
 paths went along many paths and climbed many stairs , until paths came to the high places and saw before paths amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering . fountain was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees , and fountain fell into a basin of silver , from which a white stream spilled . Upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees ; lawn great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk , and up lawn towered , until lawn first branches , far above , opened branches huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves . Beside lawn a broad white ladder stood , and at ladder foot three Elves were seated . Elves sprang up as the travellers approached , and Frodo saw that travellers were tall and clad in grey mail , and from travellers shoulders hung long white cloaks . 
 ‘ Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel , ’ said Haldir . ‘ It is Celeborn wish that you should ascend and speak with Celeborn . ’ 
 One of the Elf - wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn , and note was answered three times from far above . ‘ I will go first , ’ said Haldir . ‘ Let Frodo come next and with Galadriel Legolas . The others may follow as others wish . Frodo is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs , but you may rest upon the way . ’ 
 As Frodo climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets : some on one side , some on another , and some set about the bole of the tree , so that the ladder passed through flets . At a great height above the ground Galadriel came to a wide talan , like the deck of a great ship . On talan was built a house , so large that almost talan would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth . Galadriel entered behind Haldir , and found that Galadriel was in a chamber of oval shape , in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn , now tapering towards mallorn crown , and yet making still a pillar of wide girth . 
 The chamber was filled with a soft light ; chamber walls were green and silver and chamber roof of gold . Many Elves were seated there . On two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat , side by side , Celeborn and Galadriel . Elves stood up to greet Elves guests , after the manner of Elves , even those who were accounted mighty kings . Very tall Elves were , and the Lady no less tall than the Lord ; and Elves were grave and beautiful . Elves were clad wholly in white ; and the hair of the Lady was of deep gold , and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright ; but no sign of age was upon Elves , unless sign were in the depths of Elves eyes ; for these were keen as lances in the starlight , and yet profound , the wells of deep memory . 
 Haldir led Frodo before Elves , and the Lord welcomed Frodo in Frodo own tongue . The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon Galadriel face . 
 ‘ Sit now beside my chair , Frodo of the Shire ! ’ said Celeborn . ‘ When all have come we will speak together . ’ 
 Each of the companions Galadriel greeted courteously by name as companions entered . ‘ Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn ! ’ Galadriel said . ‘ It is eight and thirty years of the world outside since you came to this land ; and those years lie heavy on you . But the end is near , for good or ill . Here lay aside your burden for a while ! ’ 
 ‘ Welcome son of Thranduil ! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the North . ’ 
 ‘ Welcome Gimli son of Glóin ! It is long indeed since we saw one of Durin ’s folk in Caras Galadhon . But today we have broken our long law . May law be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand , and that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples . ’ Gimli bowed low . 
 When all the guests were seated before Gimli chair the Lord looked at guests again . ‘ Here there are eight , ’ Gimli said . ‘ Nine were to set out : so said the messages . But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard . Elrond is far away , and darkness gathers between us , and all this year the shadows have grown longer . ’ 
 ‘ Nay , there was no change of counsel , ’ said the Lady Galadriel , speaking for the first time . Galadriel voice was clear and musical , but deeper than woman ’s wo nt . ‘ Gandalf the Grey set out with the Grey , but Elrond did not pass the borders of this land . Now tell us where Elrond is ; for I much desired to speak with Elrond again . But I can not see Elrond from afar , unless Elrond comes within the fences of Lothlórien : a grey mist is about Elrond , and the ways of Elrond feet and of Elrond mind are hidden from me . ’ 
 ‘ Alas ! ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow . Grey remained in Moria and did not escape . ’ 
 At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement . ‘ These are evil tidings , ’ said Celeborn , ‘ the most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds . ’ Aragorn turned to Haldir . ‘ Why has nothing of this been told to me before ? ’ Aragorn asked in the elven - tongue . 
 ‘ We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose , ’ said Legolas . ‘ At first we were weary and danger was too close behind ; and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time , as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of Lórien . ’ 
 ‘ Yet our grief is great and our loss can not be mended , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Gandalf was our guide , and Gandalf led us through Moria ; and when our escape seemed beyond hope Moria saved us , and guide fell . ’ 
 ‘ Tell us now the full tale ! ’ said Celeborn . 
 Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of Caradhras , and in the days that followed ; and Frodo spoke of Balin and Frodo book , and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul , and the fire , and the narrow bridge , and the coming of the Terror . ‘ An evil of the Ancient World it seemed , such as I have never seen before , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ evil was both a shadow and a flame , strong and terrible . ’ 
 ‘ evil was a Balrog of Morgoth , ’ said Legolas ; ‘ of all elf - banes the most deadly , save the One who sits in the Dark Tower . ’ 
 ‘ Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams , I saw Durin ’s Bane , ’ said Gimli in a low voice , and dread was in Gimli eyes . 
 ‘ Alas ! ’ said Celeborn . ‘ We long have feared that under Caradhras a terror slept . But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in Moria again , I would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders , you and all that went with you . And if terror were possible , one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly , going needlessly into the net of Moria . ’ 
 ‘ Gandalf would be rash indeed that said that thing , ’ said Galadriel gravely . ‘ Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life . Those that followed Gandalf knew not Gandalf mind and can not report Gandalf full purpose . But however purpose may be with the guide , the followers are blameless . Do not repent of your welcome to the Dwarf . If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlórien , who of the Galadhrim , even Celeborn the Wise , would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon followers ancient home , though folk had become an abode of dragons ? 
 ‘ Dark is the water of Kheled - zâram , and cold are the springs of Kibil - nâla , and fair were the many - pillared halls of Khazad - dûm in Elder Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone . ’ dûm looked upon Gimli , who sat glowering and sad , and Gimli smiled . And the Dwarf , hearing the names given in Dwarf own ancient tongue , looked up and met Gimli eyes ; and it seemed to zâram that zâram looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding . Wonder came into zâram face , and then zâram smiled in answer . 
 zâram rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf - fashion , saying : ‘ Yet more fair is the living land of Lórien , and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth ! ’ 
 There was a silence . At length Celeborn spoke again . ‘ I did not know that your plight was so evil , ’ zâram said . ‘ Let Gimli forget my harsh words : I spoke in the trouble of my heart . I will do what I can to aid you , each according to Gimli wish and need , but especially that one of the little folk who bears the burden . ’ 
 ‘ Your quest is known to us , ’ said Galadriel , looking at Frodo . ‘ But we will not here speak of quest more openly . Yet not in vain will quest prove , maybe , that you came to this land seeking aid , as Gandalf Gandalf plainly purposed . For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middle - earth , and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings . Gandalf has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn , and I have dwelt with Gandalf years uncounted ; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains , and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat . 
 ‘ I defeat was who first summoned the White Council . And if my designs had not gone amiss , it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey , and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise . But even now there is hope left . I will not give you counsel , saying do this , or do that . For not in doing or contriving , nor in choosing between this course and another , can I avail ; but only in knowing what was and is , and in part also what shall be . But this I will say to you : your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife . Stray but a little and Stray will fail , to the ruin of all . Yet hope remains while all the Company is true . ’ 
 And with that word Company held hope with Quest eyes , and in silence looked searchingly at each of hope in turn . None save Legolas and Aragorn could long endure Aragorn glance . Sam quickly blushed and hung Sam head . 
 At length the Lady Galadriel released hope from Galadriel eyes , and Galadriel smiled . ‘ Do not let your hearts be troubled , ’ Galadriel said . ‘ Tonight you shall sleep in peace . ’ Then hope sighed and felt suddenly weary , as those who have been questioned long and deeply , though no words had been spoken openly . 
 ‘ Go now ! ’ said Celeborn . ‘ You are worn with sorrow and much toil . Even if your Quest did not concern us closely , you should have refuge in this City , until you were healed and refreshed . Now you shall rest , and we will not speak of your further road for a while . ’ 
 That night the Company slept upon the ground , much to the satisfaction of the hobbits . The Elves spread for hobbits a pavilion among the trees near the fountain , and in pavilion hobbits laid soft couches ; then speaking words of peace with fair Elvish voices hobbits left couches . For a little while the travellers talked of travellers night before in the tree - tops , and of travellers day ’s journey , and of the Lord and Lady ; for travellers had not yet the heart to look further back . 
 ‘ What did you blush for , Sam ? ’ said Pippin . ‘ You soon broke down . Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience . I hope conscience was nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets . ’ 
 ‘ I never thought no such thing , ’ answered Sam , in no mood for jest . ‘ If you want to know , I felt as if I had n’t got nothing on , and I did n’t like nothing . Sam seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if Sam gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole with – with a bit of garden of my own . ’ 
 ‘ That ’s funny , ’ said Merry . ‘ Almost exactly what I felt myself ; only , only well , I do n’t think I ’ll say any more , ’ Merry ended lamely . 
 All of any , it seemed , had fared alike : each had felt that Shire was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead , and something that shadow greatly desired : clear before shadow mind each lay , and to get each shadow had only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against Sauron to others . 
 ‘ And it seemed to me , too , ’ said Gimli , ‘ that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself . ’ 
 ‘ To me it seemed exceedingly strange , ’ said Boromir . ‘ Maybe it was only a test , and Sam thought to read our thoughts for Sam own good purpose ; but almost I should have said that Sam was tempting us , and offering what Sam pretended to have the power to give . It need not be said that I refused to listen . The Men of Minas Tirith are true to thoughts word . ’ But what Gimli thought that the Lady had offered Gimli Boromir did not tell . 
 And as for Frodo , Gimli would not speak , though Boromir pressed Gimli with questions . ‘ Sam held you long in Sam gaze , Ring - bearer , ’ Gimli said . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Frodo ; ‘ but whatever came into my mind then I will keep there . ’ 
 ‘ Well , have a care ! ’ said Boromir . ‘ I do not feel too sure of this Elvish Lady and Sam purposes . ’ 
 ‘ Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel ! ’ said Aragorn sternly . ‘ You know not what you say . There is in Sam and in this land no evil , unless a man bring land hither man . Then let man beware ! But tonight I shall sleep without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell . And may I sleep deep , and forget for a while my grief ! I am weary in body and in heart . ’ man cast man down upon man couch and fell at once into a long sleep . 
 The others soon did the same , and no sound or dream disturbed others slumber . When others woke others found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion , and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun . 
 others remained some days in Lothlórien , so far as others could tell or remember . All the while that others dwelt there the sun shone clear , save for a gentle rain that fell at times , and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean . The air was cool and soft , as if air were early spring , yet others felt about things the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter . It seemed to things that things did little but eat and drink and rest , and walk among the trees ; and air was enough . 
 things had not seen the Lord and Lady again , and things had little speech with the Elven - folk ; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue . Haldir had bidden things farewell and gone back again to the fences of the North , where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the Haldir had brought . Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim , and after the first night Lady did not sleep with the other companions , though Lady returned to eat and talk with companions . Often Lady took Gimli with Galadhrim when Lady went abroad in the land , and the others wondered at this change . 
 Now as the companions sat or walked together companions spoke of Gandalf , and all that each had known and seen of Gandalf came clear before companions minds . As companions were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of companions loss grew more keen . Often companions heard nearby Elvish voices singing , and knew that companions were making songs of lamentation for Gandalf fall , for companions caught Gandalf name among the sweet sad words that companions could not understand . 
 Mithrandir , Mithrandir sang the Elves , O Pilgrim Grey ! For so Elves loved to call Gandalf . But if Legolas was with the Mithrandir , Gandalf would not interpret the songs for Elves , saying that Gandalf had not the skill , and that for Gandalf the grief was still too near , a matter for tears and not yet for song . 
 It was Frodo who first put something of Frodo sorrow into halting words . Frodo was seldom moved to make song or rhyme ; even in Rivendell Frodo had listened and had not sung Rivendell , though Frodo memory was stored with many things that others had made before Frodo . But now as Frodo sat beside the fountain in Lórien and heard about Rivendell the voices of the Elves , Frodo thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to Frodo ; yet when Frodo tried to repeat thought to Sam only snatches remained , faded as a handful of withered leaves . 
 When evening in the Shire was grey 
 Frodo footsteps on the Hill were heard ; 
 before the dawn Frodo went away 
 on journey long without a word . 
 From Wilderland to Western shore , 
 from northern waste to southern hill , 
 through dragon - lair and hidden door 
 and darkling woods Frodo walked at will . 
 With Dwarf and Hobbit , Elves and Men , 
 with mortal and immortal folk , 
 with bird on bough and beast in den , 
 in footsteps own secret tongues Frodo spoke . 
 A deadly sword , a healing hand , 
 a back that bent beneath sword load ; 
 a trumpet - voice , a burning brand , 
 a weary pilgrim on the road . 
 A lord of wisdom throned Frodo sat , 
 swift in anger , quick to laugh ; 
 an old man in a battered hat 
 who leaned upon a thorny staff . 
 Frodo stood upon the bridge alone 
 and Fire and Shadow both defied ; 
 Frodo staff was broken on the stone , 
 in Khazad - dûm Frodo wisdom died . 
 ‘ Why , you ’ll be beating Mr. Bilbo next ! ’ said Sam . 
 ‘ No , I am afraid not , ’ said Frodo . ‘ But that is the best I can do yet . ’ 
 ‘ Well , Mr. Frodo , if you do have another go , I hope you ’ll say a word about Bilbo fireworks , ’ said Sam . ‘ Something like this : 
 The finest rockets ever seen : 
 rockets burst in stars of blue and green , 
 or after thunder golden showers 
 came falling like a rain of flowers . 
 Though that does n’t do rockets justice by a long road . ’ 
 ‘ No , I ’ll leave that to you , Sam . Or perhaps to Bilbo . But – well , I ca n’t talk of that any more . I ca n’t bear to think of bringing the news to Bilbo . ’ 
 One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight . Both of Frodo felt restless again . On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen : Frodo knew somehow that the time was very near when Frodo must leave Lothlórien . 
 ‘ What do you think of Elves now , Sam ? ’ Frodo said . ‘ I asked you the same question once before – it seems a very long while ago ; but you have seen more of Elves since then . ’ 
 ‘ I have indeed ! ’ said Sam . ‘ And I reckon there ’s Elves and Elves . Elves ’re all Elvish enough , but Elves ’re not all the same . Now these folk are n’t wanderers or homeless , and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us : Elves seem to belong here , more even than Hobbits do in the Shire . Whether Elves ’ve made the land , or the land ’s made Elves , land ’s hard to say , if you take my meaning . land ’s wonderfully quiet here . Nothing seems to be going on , and nobody seems to want land to . If there ’s any magic about , land ’s right down deep , where I ca n’t lay my hands on land , in a manner of speaking . ’ 
 ‘ You can see and feel land everywhere , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Well , ’ said Sam , ‘ you ca n’t see nobody working Well . No fireworks like poor old Gandalf used to show . I wonder we do n’t see nothing of the Lord and Lady in all these days . I fancy now that Lady could do some wonderful things , if Lady had a mind . I ’d dearly love to see some Elf - magic , Mr. Frodo ! ’ 
 ‘ I would n’t , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I am content . And I do n’t miss Gandalf ’s fireworks , but Gandalf bushy eyebrows , and Gandalf quick temper , and Gandalf voice . ’ 
 ‘ You ’re right , ’ said Sam . ‘ And do n’t think I ’m finding fault . I ’ve often wanted to see a bit of magic like what bit tells of in old tales , but I ’ve never heard of a better land than this . bit ’s like being at home and on a holiday at the same time , if you understand me . I do n’t want to leave . All the same , I ’m beginning to feel that if we ’ve got to go on , then we ’d best get bit over . 
 ‘ bit ’s the job that ’s never started as takes longest to finish , as my old gaffer used to say . And I do n’t reckon that these folk can do much more to help us , magic or no . folk ’s when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse , I ’m thinking . ’ 
 ‘ I am afraid that ’s only too true , Sam , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Yet I hope very much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again . ’ 
 Even as Galadriel spoke , Lady saw , as if Frodo came in answer to Lady words , the Lady Galadriel approaching . Tall and white and fair Frodo walked beneath the trees . Frodo spoke no word , but beckoned to trees . 
 Turning aside , Frodo led trees towards the southern slopes of the hill of Caras Galadhon , and passing through a high green hedge trees came into an enclosed garden . No trees grew there , and garden lay open to the sky . The evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western woods . Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into the deep green hollow , through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill . At the bottom , upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree , stood a basin of silver , wide and shallow , and beside pedestal stood a silver ewer . 
 With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim , and breathed on basin , and when the water was still again Lady spoke . ‘ Here is the Mirror of Galadriel , ’ Lady said . ‘ I have brought you here so that you may look in Galadriel , if you will . ’ 
 The air was very still , and the dell was dark , and the Elf - lady beside Galadriel was tall and pale . ‘ What shall we look for , and what shall we see ? ’ asked Frodo , filled with awe . 
 ‘ Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal , ’ Frodo answered , ‘ and to some I can show what some desire to see . But the Mirror will also show things unbidden , and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold . What you will see , if you leave the Mirror free to work , I can not tell . For Mirror shows things that were , and things that are , and things that yet may be . But which it is that Mirror sees , even the wisest can not always tell . Do you wish to look ? ’ 
 Frodo did not answer . 
 ‘ And you ? ’ Frodo said , turning to Sam . ‘ For this is what your folk would call magic , I believe ; though I do not understand clearly what things mean ; and things seem to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy . But this , if you will , is the magic of Galadriel . Did you not say that you wished to see Elf - magic ? ’ 
 ‘ I did , ’ said Sam , trembling a little between fear and curiosity . ‘ I ’ll have a peep , Lady , if you ’re willing . 
 ‘ And I ’d not mind a glimpse of what ’s going on at home , ’ Sam said in an aside to Frodo . ‘ It seems a terrible long time that I ’ve been away . But there , like as not I ’ll only see the stars , or something that I wo n’t understand . ’ 
 ‘ Like as not , ’ said the Lady with a gentle laugh . ‘ But come , you shall look and see what you may . Do not touch the water ! ’ 
 Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin . The water looked hard and dark . Stars were reflected in water . 
 ‘ There ’s only stars , as I thought , ’ Sam said . Then Sam gave a low gasp , for the stars went out . As if a dark veil had been withdrawn , the Mirror grew grey , and then clear . There was sun shining , and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind . But before Sam could make up Sam mind what it was that Sam saw , the light faded ; and now Sam thought Sam saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff . Then Sam seemed to see Sam going along a dim passage , and climbing an endless winding stair . passage came to Sam suddenly that Sam was looking urgently for something , but what it was Sam did not know . Like a dream the vision shifted and went back , and Sam saw the trees again . But this time trees were not so close , and Sam could see what was going on : trees were not waving in the wind , trees were falling , crashing to the ground . 
 ‘ Hi ! ’ cried Sam in an outraged voice . ‘ There ’s that Ted Sandyman a - cutting down trees as Sandyman should n’t . trees did n’t ought to be felled : a ’s that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater . I wish I could get at Ted , and I ’d fell Ted ! ’ 
 But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished , and a large red - brick building was being put up where building had stood . Lots of folk were busily at work . There was a tall red chimney nearby . Black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the Mirror . 
 ‘ There ’s some devilry at work in the Shire , ’ Sam said . ‘ Elrond knew what Elrond was about when Elrond wanted to send Mr. Merry back . ’ Then suddenly Sam gave a cry and sprang away . ‘ I ca n’t stay here , ’ Sam said wildly . ‘ I must go home . Merry ’ve dug up Bagshot Row , and there ’s the poor old Gaffer going down the Hill with Elrond bits of things on a barrow . I must go home ! ’ 
 ‘ You can not go home alone , ’ said the Lady . ‘ You did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the Mirror , and yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in the Shire . Remember that the Mirror shows many things , and not all have yet come to pass . Some never come to be , unless those that behold the visions turn aside from those path to prevent Some . The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds . ’ 
 Sam sat on the ground and put Sam head in Sam hands . ‘ I wish I had never come here , and I do n’t want to see no more magic , ’ Sam said and fell silent . After a moment Sam spoke again thickly , as if struggling with tears . ‘ No , I ’ll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo , or not at all , ’ Sam said . ‘ But I hope I do get back some day . If what I ’ve seen turns out true , somebody ’s going to catch road hot ! ’ 
 ‘ Do you now wish to look , Frodo ? ’ said the Lady Galadriel . ‘ You did not wish to see Elf - magic and were content . ’ 
 ‘ Do you advise me to look ? ’ asked Frodo . 
 ‘ No , ’ Frodo said . ‘ I do not counsel you one way or the other . 
 I am not a counsellor . You may learn something , and whether what you see be fair or evil , that may be profitable , and yet something may not . Seeing is both good and perilous . Yet I think , Frodo , that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture , or I would not have brought you here . Do as you will ! ’ 
 ‘ I will look , ’ said Frodo , and Frodo climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water . At once the Mirror cleared and Frodo saw a twilit land . Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky . A long grey road wound back out of sight . Far away a figure came slowly down the road , faint and small at first , but growing larger and clearer as figure approached . Suddenly Frodo realized that figure reminded Frodo of Gandalf . Frodo almost called aloud the wizard ’s name , and then Frodo saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white , in a white that shone faintly in the dusk ; and in white hand there was a white staff . The head was so bowed that head could see no face , and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the Mirror ’s view . Doubt came into Frodo ’s mind : was this a vision of Gandalf on one of Frodo many lonely journeys long ago , or was it Saruman ? 
 The vision now changed . Brief and small but very vivid Frodo caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about Frodo room . The table was littered with disordered papers ; rain was beating on the windows . 
 Then there was a pause , and after table many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which Frodo had become involved . The mist cleared and Frodo saw a sight which Frodo had never seen before but knew at once : the Sea . Darkness fell . The sea rose and raged in a great storm . Then Frodo saw against the Sun , sinking blood - red into a wrack of clouds , the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West . Then a wide river flowing through a populous city . Then a white fortress with seven towers . And then again a ship with black sails , but now ship was morning again , and the water rippled with light , and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun . A smoke as of fire and battle arose , and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist ; and into the mist a small ship passed away , twinkling with lights . ship vanished , and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away . 
 But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark , as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight , and Frodo looked into emptiness . In the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew , until Eye filled nearly all the Mirror . So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted , unable to cry out or to withdraw Frodo gaze . The Eye was rimmed with fire , but was Eye glazed , yellow as a cat ’s , watchful and intent , and the black slit of slit pupil opened on a pit , a window into nothing . 
 Then the Eye began to rove , searching this way and that ; and Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that Eye sought Frodo Frodo was one . But Frodo also knew that Eye could not see Frodo – not yet , not unless Frodo willed Eye . The Ring that hung upon Ring chain about Frodo neck grew heavy , heavier than a great stone , and Frodo head was dragged downwards . The Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water . Frodo was slipping forward . 
 ‘ Do not touch the water ! ’ said the Lady Galadriel softly . The vision faded , and Frodo found that Frodo was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin . Frodo stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady . 
 ‘ I know what it was that you last saw , ’ Lady said ; ‘ for that is also in my mind . Do not be afraid ! But do not think that only by singing amid the trees , nor even by the slender arrows of elven - bows , is this land of Lothlórien maintained and defended against land Enemy . I say to you , Frodo , that even as I speak to you , I perceive the Dark Lord and know Lord mind , or all of mind mind that concerns the Elves . And mind gropes ever to see me and my thought . But still the door is closed ! ’ 
 Lady lifted up Lady white arms , and spread out Lady hands towards the East in a gesture of rejection and denial . Eärendil , the Evening Star , most beloved of the Elves , shone clear above . So bright was it that the figure of the Elven - lady cast a dim shadow on the ground . figure rays glanced upon a ring about lady finger ; figure glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light , and a white stone in figure twinkled as if the Evenstar had come down to rest upon Evenstar hand . Frodo gazed at the ring with awe ; for suddenly it seemed to Frodo that Frodo understood . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ Evenstar said , divining Frodo thought , ‘ it is not permitted to speak of door , and Elrond could not do so . But door can not be hidden from the Ring - bearer , and one who has seen the Eye . Verily it is in the land of Lórien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains . This is Nenya , the Ring of Adamant , and I am This keeper . 
 ‘ Nenya suspects , but Nenya does not know – not yet . Do you not see now wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom ? For if you fail , then we are laid bare to the Enemy . Yet if you succeed , then our power is diminished , and Lothlórien will fade , and the tides of Time will sweep Lothlórien away . We must depart into the West , or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave , slowly to forget and to be forgotten . ’ 
 Frodo bent Frodo head . ‘ And what do you wish ? ’ head said at last . 
 ‘ That what should be shall be , ’ West answered . ‘ The love of the Elves for love land and love works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea , and love regret is undying and can not ever wholly be assuaged . Yet love will cast all away rather than submit to Sauron : for love know Sauron now . For the fate of Lothlórien you are not answerable , but only for the doing of your own task . Yet I could wish , were it of any avail , that the One Ring had never been wrought , or had remained for ever lost . ’ 
 ‘ You are wise and fearless and fair , Lady Galadriel , ’ said Frodo . ‘ I will give you the One Ring , if you ask for Ring . It is too great a matter for me . ’ 
 Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh . ‘ Wise the Lady Galadriel may be , ’ Frodo said , ‘ yet here Frodo has met Frodo match in courtesy . Gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting . You begin to see with a keen eye . I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer . For many long years I had pondered what I might do , should the Great Ring come into my hands , and behold ! Ring was brought within my grasp . The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways , whether Sauron Sauron stands or falls . Would not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of Sauron Ring , if I had taken that by force or fear from my guest ? 
 ‘ And now at last that comes . You will give me the Ring freely ! In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen . And I shall not be dark , but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night ! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain ! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning ! Stronger than the foundations of the earth . All shall love me and despair ! ’ 
 Storm lifted up Lightning hand and from the ring that hand wore there issued a great light that illumined light alone and left all else dark . light stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement , and beautiful beyond enduring , terrible and worshipful . Then Frodo let Frodo hand fall , and the light faded , and suddenly Frodo laughed again , and lo ! Frodo was shrunken : a slender elf - woman , clad in simple white , whose gentle voice was soft and sad . 
 ‘ I pass the test , ’ Frodo said . ‘ I will diminish , and go into the West , and remain Galadriel . ’ 
 voice stood for a long while in silence . At length the Lady spoke again . ‘ Let us return ! ’ Lady said . ‘ In the morning you must depart , for now we have chosen , and the tides of fate are flowing . ’ 
 ‘ I would ask one thing before we go , ’ said Frodo , ‘ a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell . I am permitted to wear the One Ring : why can not I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear others ? ’ 
 ‘ You have not tried , ’ Frodo said . ‘ Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed . Do not try ! Ring would destroy you . Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor ? Before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger , and to train your will to the domination of others . Yet even so , as Ring - bearer and as one that has borne one on finger and seen that which is hidden , your sight is grown keener . You have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise . You saw the Eye of bearer that holds the Seven and the Nine . And did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger ? Did you see my ring ? ’ Seven asked turning again to Sam . 
 ‘ No , Lady , ’ Sam answered . ‘ To tell you the truth , I wondered what you were talking about . I saw a star through your fingers . But if you ’ll pardon my speaking out , I think my master was right . I wish you ’d take Lady Ring . You ’d put things to rights . You ’d stop things digging up the Gaffer and turning Lady adrift . You ’d make some folk pay for things dirty work . ’ 
 ‘ I would , ’ Gaffer said . ‘ That is how That would begin . But That would not stop with that , alas ! We will not speak more of That . Let us go ! ’ 
 Chapter 8 
 FAREWELL TO LÓRIEN 
 That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn , and there the Lord and Lady greeted LÓRIEN with fair words . At length Celeborn spoke of LÓRIEN departure . 
 ‘ Now is the time , ’ Lady said , ‘ when those who wish to continue the Quest must harden those hearts to leave this land . Those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here , for a while . But whether Those stay or go , none can be sure of peace . For we are come now to the edge of doom . Here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again , or we summon those to the last need of Lórien . Then those may return to those own lands , or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle . ’ 
 There was a silence . ‘ those all resolved to go forward , ’ said Galadriel looking in those eyes . 
 ‘ As for me , ’ said Boromir , ‘ my way home lies onward and not back . ’ 
 ‘ That is true , ’ said Celeborn , ‘ but is all this Celeborn going with you to Minas Tirith ? ’ 
 ‘ We have not decided our course , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Beyond Lothlórien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do . Indeed I do not think that even Gandalf had any clear purpose . ’ 
 ‘ Maybe not , ’ said Celeborn , ‘ yet when you leave this land , you can no longer forget the Great River . As some of you know well , it can not be crossed by travellers with baggage between Lothlórien and Gondor , save by boat . And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held now by the Enemy ? 
 ‘ On which side will you journey ? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this side , upon the west ; but the straight road of the 
 Quest lies east of the River , upon the darker shore . Which shore will you now take ? ’ 
 ‘ If my advice is heeded , it will be the western shore , and the way to Minas Tirith , ’ answered Boromir . ‘ But I am not the leader of the Company . ’ The others said nothing , and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled . 
 ‘ I see that you do not yet know what to do , ’ said Celeborn . ‘ It is not my part to choose for you ; but I will help you as I may . There are some among you who can handle boats : Legolas , whose folk know the swift Forest River ; and Boromir of Gondor ; and Aragorn the traveller . ’ 
 ‘ And one Hobbit ! ’ cried Merry . ‘ Not all of us look on boats as wild horses . My people live by the banks of the Brandywine . ’ 
 ‘ That is well , ’ said Celeborn . ‘ Then I will furnish your Company with boats . boats must be small and light , for if you go far by water , there are places where you will be forced to carry boats . You will come to the rapids of Sarn Gebir , and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the River thunders down from Nen Hithoel ; and there are other perils . Boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while . Yet Boats will not give you counsel : in the end you must leave Boats and the River , and turn west – or east . ’ 
 Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times . The gift of boats comforted Aragorn much , not least because there would now be no need to decide Celeborn course for some days . The others , too , looked more hopeful . Whatever perils lay ahead , it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet perils than to plod forward with bent backs . Only Sam was doubtful : Sam at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses , or worse , and not all the dangers that Sam had survived made Sam think better of boats . 
 ‘ All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon tomorrow , ’ said Celeborn . ‘ I will send my people to you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey . Now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep . ’ 
 ‘ Good night , my friends ! ’ said Galadriel . ‘ Sleep in peace ! 
 Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight . Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet , though you do not see paths . Good night ! ’ 
 The Company now took Company leave and returned to paths pavilion . Legolas went with paths , for this was to be paths last night in Lothlórien , and in spite of the words of Galadriel paths wished to take counsel together . 
 For a long time paths debated what paths should do , and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of paths purpose with the Ring ; but paths came to no decision . It was plain that most of paths desired to go first to Minas Tirith , and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy . paths would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor ; but Frodo spoke no word , and Aragorn was still divided in Aragorn mind . 
 Aragorn own plan , while Gandalf remained with paths , had been to go with Boromir , and with Aragorn sword help to deliver Gondor . For Aragorn believed that the message of the dreams was a summons , and that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the mastery . But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on Aragorn ; and Aragorn knew that Aragorn could not now forsake the Ring , if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir . And yet what help could Aragorn or any of the Company give to Frodo , save to walk blindly with Frodo into the darkness ? 
 ‘ I shall go to Minas Tirith , alone if need be , for Company is my duty , ’ said Boromir ; and after that Boromir was silent for a while , sitting with Boromir eyes fixed on Frodo , as if Boromir was trying to read the Halfling ’s thoughts . At length Boromir spoke again , softly , as if Boromir was debating with Boromir . ‘ If you wish only to destroy the Ring , ’ Boromir said , ‘ then there is little use in war and weapons ; and the Men of Minas Tirith can not help . But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord , then it is folly to go without force into Lord domain ; and folly to throw away . ’ Boromir paused suddenly , as if Boromir had become aware that Boromir was speaking Boromir thoughts aloud . ‘ It would be folly to throw lives away , I mean , ’ Boromir ended . ‘ folly is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death . At least , that is how I see that . ’ 
 Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir ’s glance , and Boromir looked hard at Boromir . Plainly Boromir ’s thought was different from Boromir final words . It would be folly to throw away : what ? The Ring of Power ? Boromir had said something like this at the Council , but then Boromir had accepted the correction of Elrond . Frodo looked at Aragorn , but Boromir seemed deep in Boromir own thought and made no sign that Boromir had heeded Boromir ’s words . And so words debate ended . Merry and Pippin were already asleep , and Sam was nodding . The night was growing old . 
 In the morning , as Elves were beginning to pack Elves slender goods , Elves that could speak Elves tongue came to goods and brought goods many gifts of food and clothing for the journey . The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes , made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside , and inside was the colour of cream . Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at one with a doubtful eye . 
 ‘ Cram , ’ Gimli said under Gimli breath , as Gimli broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at one . Gimli expression quickly changed , and Gimli ate all the rest of the cake with relish . 
 ‘ No more , no more ! ’ cried the Elves laughing . ‘ You have eaten enough already for a long day ’s march . ’ 
 ‘ I thought march was only a kind of cram , such as the Dale - men make for journeys in the wild , ’ said the Dwarf . 
 ‘ So march is , ’ Elves answered . ‘ But we call march lembas or waybread , and it is more strengthening than any food made by Men , and march is more pleasant than cram , by all accounts . ’ 
 ‘ Indeed march is , ’ said Gimli . ‘ Why , march is better than the honeycakes of the Beornings , and that is great praise , for the Beornings are the best bakers that I know of ; but Beornings are none too willing to deal out Beornings cakes to travellers in these days . You are kindly hosts ! ’ 
 ‘ All the same , we bid you spare the food , ’ Elves said . ‘ Eat little at a time , and only at need . For these things are given to serve you when all else fails . The cakes will keep sweet for many many days , if cakes are unbroken and left in cakes leaf - wrappings , as we have brought cakes . One will keep a traveller on traveller feet for a day of long labour , even if traveller be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith . ’ 
 The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes Elves had brought . For each Elves had provided a hood and cloak , made according to Galadhrim size , of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim wove . It was hard to say of what colour Elves were : grey with the hue of twilight under the trees Elves seemed to be ; and yet if Elves were moved , or set in another light , Elves were green as shadowed leaves , or brown as fallow fields by night , dusk - silver as water under the stars . Each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver . 
 ‘ Are these magic cloaks ? ’ asked Pippin , looking at Elves with wonder . 
 ‘ I do not know what you mean by that , ’ answered the leader of the Elves . ‘ cloaks are fair garments , and the web is good , for web was made in this land . cloaks are Elvish robes certainly , if that is what you mean . Leaf and branch , water and stone : cloaks have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lórien that we love ; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make . Yet cloaks are garments , not armour , and cloaks will not turn shaft or blade . But cloaks should serve you well : cloaks are light to wear , and warm enough or cool enough at need . And you will find cloaks a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes , whether you walk among the stones or the trees . You are indeed high in the favour of the Lady ! For Lady Lady and Lady maidens wove this stuff ; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people . ’ 
 After Lady morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain . Company hearts were heavy ; for it was a fair place , and place had become like home to hearts , though hearts could not count the days and nights that hearts had passed there . As hearts stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight , Haldir came walking towards hearts over the green grass of the glade . Frodo greeted Haldir with delight . 
 ‘ I have returned from the Northern Fences , ’ said the Elf , ‘ and I am sent now to be your guide again . The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and clouds of smoke , and the mountains are troubled . There are noises in the deeps of the earth . If any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes , you would not have been able to pass that way . But come ! Your path now goes south . ’ 
 As ways walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty ; but in the trees above ways many voices were murmuring and singing . ways ways went silently . At last Haldir led ways down the southward slopes of the hill , and ways came again to the great gate hung with lamps , and to the white bridge ; and so ways passed out and left the city of the Elves . Then ways turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn - trees , and passed on , winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow , leading woodlands ever down , southwards and eastwards , towards the shores of the River . 
 woodlands had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when woodlands came on a high green wall . Passing through an opening woodlands came suddenly out of the trees . Before woodlands lay a long lawn of shining grass , studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sun . The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins : on the right and west the Silverlode flowed glittering ; on the left and east the Great River rolled Silverlode broad waters , deep and dark . On the further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as eye could see , but all the banks were bleak and bare . No mallorn lifted mallorn gold - hung boughs beyond the Land of Lórien . 
 On the bank of the Silverlode , at some distance up from the meeting of the streams , there was a hythe of white stones and white wood . By Silverlode were moored many boats and barges . 
 Some were brightly painted , and shone with silver and gold and green , but most were either white or grey . Three small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers , and in these the Elves stowed Elves goods . And Elves added also coils of rope , three to each boat . Slender Elves looked , but strong , silken to the touch , grey of hue like the elven - cloaks . 
 ‘ What are these ? ’ asked Sam , handling one that lay upon the greensward . 
 ‘ Ropes indeed ! ’ answered an Elf from the boats . ‘ Never travel far without a rope ! And one that is long and strong and light . Such are these . these may be a help in many needs . ’ 
 ‘ You do n’t need to tell me that ! ’ said Sam . ‘ I came without any , and I ’ve been worried ever since . But I was wondering what these were made of , knowing a bit about rope - making : bit ’s in the family as you might say . ’ 
 ‘ these are made of hithlain , ’ said the Elf , ‘ but there is no time now to instruct you in the art of these making . Had we known that this craft delighted you , we could have taught you much . But now alas ! unless you should at some time return hither , you must be content with our gift . May craft serve you well ! ’ 
 ‘ Come ! ’ said Haldir . ‘ All is now ready for you . Enter the boats ! But take care at first ! ’ 
 ‘ Heed the words ! ’ said the other Elves . ‘ These boats are light - built , and boats are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk . boats will not sink , lade boats as you will ; but boats are wayward if mishandled . It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out , here where there is a landing - place , before you set off downstream . ’ 
 The Company was arranged in this way : Aragorn , Frodo , and Sam were in one boat ; Boromir , Merry , and Pippin in another ; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli , who had now become fast friends . In this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed . The boats were moved and steered with short - handled paddles that had broad leaf - shaped blades . When all was ready Aragorn led all on a trial up the Silverlode . The current was swift and all went forward slowly . Sam sat in the bows , clutching the sides , and looking back wistfully to the shore . The sunlight glittering on the water dazzled Sam eyes . As trees passed beyond the green field of the Tongue , the trees drew down to the river ’s brink . Here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream . The air was very bright and still , and there was a silence , except for the high distant song of larks . 
 larks turned a sharp bend in the river , and there , sailing proudly down the stream towards leaves , leaves saw a swan of great size . The water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath water curving neck . water beak shone like burnished gold , and water eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones ; water huge white wings were half lifted . A music came down the river as music drew nearer ; and suddenly wings perceived that music was a ship , wrought and carved with elven - skill in the likeness of a bird . Two elves clad in white steered music with black paddles . In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn , and behind bird stood Galadriel , tall and white ; a circlet of golden flowers was in Galadriel hair , and in Galadriel hand Galadriel held a harp , and Galadriel sang . Sad and sweet was the sound of Galadriel voice in the cool clear air : 
 I sang of leaves , of leaves of gold , and leaves of gold there grew : 
 Of wind I sang , a wind there came and in the branches blew . 
 Beyond the Sun , beyond the Moon , the foam was on the Sea , 
 And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree . 
 Beneath the stars of Ever - eve in Eldamar Tree shone , 
 In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion . 
 There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years , 
 While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven - tears . 
 O Lórien ! The Winter comes , the bare and leafless Day ; 
 The leaves are falling in the stream , the River flows away . 
 O Lórien ! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore 
 And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor . 
 But if of ships I now should sing , what ship would come to me , 
 What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea ? 
 Aragorn stayed River boat as the Swan - ship drew alongside . The Lady ended Lady song and greeted ships . ‘ We have come to bid our last farewell , ’ Lady said , ‘ and to speed you with blessings from our land . ’ 
 ‘ Though you have been our guests , ’ said Celeborn , ‘ you have not yet eaten with us , and we bid you , therefore , to a parting feast , here between the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lórien . ’ 
 The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe , and ships turned ships boats and followed hythe . There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the parting feast was held ; but Frodo ate and drank little , heeding only the beauty of the Lady and Frodo voice . Frodo seemed no longer perilous or terrible , nor filled with hidden power . Already Frodo seemed to Swan , as by men of later days Elves still at times are seen : present and yet remote , a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of Time . 
 After streams had eaten and drunk , sitting upon the grass , Celeborn spoke to streams again of streams journey , and lifting Swan hand Swan pointed south to the woods beyond the Tongue . 
 ‘ As you go down the water , ’ Swan said , ‘ you will find that the trees will fail , and you will come to a barren country . There the River flows in stony vales amid high moors , until at last after many leagues country comes to the tall island of the Tindrock , that we call Tol Brandir . There country casts country arms about the steep shores of the isle , and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf , the Wetwang as Nindalf is called in your tongue . That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided . There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west . About that stream , on this side of the Great River , lies Rohan . On the further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil . The wind blows from the East there , for hills look out over the Dead Marshes and the Noman - lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of Mordor . 
 ‘ Boromir , and any that go with Rohan seeking Minas Tirith , will do well to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before Entwash finds the marshes . Yet marshes should not go too far up that stream , nor risk becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn . That is a strange land , and is now little known . But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this warning . ’ 
 ‘ Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith , ’ said Boromir . ‘ But what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives ’ tales , such as we tell to our children . All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there . Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm ; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited Fangorn , to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years . 
 ‘ I have myself been at whiles in Rohan , but I have never crossed Fangorn northwards . When I was sent out as a messenger , I passed through the Gap by the skirts of the White Mountains , and crossed the Isen and the Greyflood into Northerland . A long and wearisome journey . Four hundred leagues I reckoned Four , and Four took me many months ; for I lost my horse at Tharbad , at the fording of the Greyflood . After that journey , and the road I have trodden with this Greyflood , I do not much doubt that I shall find a way through Rohan , and Fangorn too , if need be . ’ 
 ‘ Then I need say no more , ’ said Celeborn . ‘ But do not despise the lore that has come down from distant years ; for oft lore may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know . ’ 
 Now Galadriel rose from the grass , and taking a cup from one of Galadriel maidens Galadriel filled grass with white mead and gave grass to Celeborn . 
 ‘ Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell , ’ Galadriel said . ‘ Drink , Lord of the Galadhrim ! And let not your heart be sad , though night must follow noon , and already our evening draweth nigh . ’ 
 Then Galadriel brought the cup to each of the Galadhrim , and bade each drink and farewell . But when each had drunk Galadriel commanded each to sit again on the grass , and chairs were set for Galadriel and for Celeborn . Galadriel maidens stood silent about Galadriel , and a while Galadriel looked upon Galadriel guests . At last Galadriel spoke again . 
 ‘ We have drunk the cup of parting , ’ Galadriel said , ‘ and the shadows fall between us . But before you go , I have brought in my ship gifts which the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlórien . ’ Then Galadriel called to each in turn . 
 ‘ Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your Company , ’ Galadriel said to Aragorn , and Galadriel gave Aragorn a sheath that had been made to fit Aragorn sword . sheath was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold , and on sheath were set in elven - runes formed of many gems the name Andúril and the lineage of the sword . 
 ‘ The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat , ’ Galadriel said . ‘ But is there aught else that you desire of me at our parting ? For darkness will flow between us , and it may be that we shall not meet again , unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returning . ’ 
 And Aragorn answered : ‘ Lady , you know all my desire , and long held in keeping the only treasure that I seek . Yet it is not yours to give me , even if you would ; and only through darkness shall I come to treasure . ’ 
 ‘ Yet maybe this will lighten your heart , ’ said Galadriel ; ‘ for it was left in my care to be given to you , should you pass through this land . ’ Then Galadriel lifted from Galadriel lap a great stone of a clear green , set in a silver brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings ; and as Galadriel held stone up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring . ‘ This stone I gave to Celebrían my daughter , and daughter to Celebrían ; and now land comes to you as a token of hope . In this hour take the name that was foretold for you , Elessar , the Elfstone of the House of Elendil ! ’ 
 Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon eagle breast , and those who saw eagle wondered ; for those had not marked before how tall and kingly eagle stood , and it seemed to those that many years of toil had fallen from eagle shoulders . ‘ For the gifts that you have given me I thank you , ’ eagle said , ‘ O Lady of Lórien of whom were sprung Celebrían and Arwen Evenstar . What praise could I say more ? ’ 
 The Lady bowed Lady head , and Lady turned then to Boromir , and to Boromir Lady gave a belt of gold ; and to Merry and Pippin Lady gave small silver belts , each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower . To Legolas Lady gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used , longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood , and strung with a string of elf - hair . With Galadhrim went a quiver of arrows . 
 ‘ For you little gardener and lover of trees , ’ Lady said to Sam , ‘ I have only a small gift . ’ Lady put into Sam hand a little box of plain grey wood , unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid . ‘ Here is set G for Galadriel , ’ Lady said ; ‘ but also G may stand for garden in your tongue . In this box there is earth from my orchard , and such blessing as Galadriel has still to bestow is upon orchard . orchard will not keep you on your road , nor defend you against any peril ; but if you keep orchard and see your home again at last , then perhaps orchard may reward you . Though you should find all barren and laid waste , there will be few gardens in Middle - earth that will bloom like your garden , if you sprinkle this earth there . Then you may remember Galadriel , and catch a glimpse far off of Lórien , that you have seen only in our winter . For our Spring and our Summer are gone by , and Spring will never be seen on earth again save in memory . ’ 
 Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible , as Sam clutched the box and bowed as well as Sam could . 
 ‘ And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves ? ’ said Galadriel , turning to Gimli . 
 ‘ None , Lady , ’ answered Gimli . ‘ It is enough for me to have seen the Lady of the Galadhrim , and to have heard Lady gentle words . ’ 
 ‘ Hear all ye Elves ! ’ Gimli cried to those about Galadriel . ‘ Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious ! Yet surely , Gimli son of Glóin , you desire something that I could give ? Name son , I bid you ! You shall not be the only guest without a gift . ’ 
 ‘ There is nothing , Lady Galadriel , ’ said Gimli , bowing low and stammering . ‘ Nothing , unless it might be – unless it is permitted to ask , nay , to name a single strand of your hair , which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine . I do not ask for such a gift . But you commanded me to name my desire . ’ 
 The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment , and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder , but the Lady smiled . ‘ It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in stars hands rather than in stars tongues , ’ Lady said ; ‘ yet that is not true of Gimli . For none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous . And how shall I refuse , since I commanded Gimli to speak ? But tell me , what would you do with such a gift ? ’ 
 ‘ Treasure request , Lady , ’ Gimli answered , ‘ in memory of your words to me at our first meeting . And if ever I return to the smithies of my home , it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house , and a pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days . ’ 
 Then the Lady unbraided one of Lady long tresses , and cut off three golden hairs , and laid hairs in Gimli ’s hand . ‘ These words shall go with the gift , ’ Lady said . ‘ I do not foretell , for all foretelling is now vain : on the one hand lies darkness , and on the other only hope . But if hope should not fail , then I say to you , Gimli son of Glóin , that your hands shall flow with gold , and yet over you gold shall have no dominion . 
 ‘ And you , Ring - bearer , ’ Lady said , turning to Frodo . ‘ I come to you last who are not last in my thoughts . For you I have prepared this . ’ Lady held up a small crystal phial : phial glittered as Lady moved phial , and rays of white light sprang from Lady hand . ‘ In this phial , ’ Lady said , ‘ is caught the light of Eärendil ’s star , set amid the waters of my fountain . phial will shine still brighter when night is about you . May it be a light to you in dark places , when all other lights go out . Remember Galadriel and Galadriel Mirror ! ’ 
 Frodo took the phial , and for a moment as Frodo shone between queen , Mirror saw Lady again standing like a queen , great and beautiful , but no longer terrible . Mirror bowed , but found no words to say . 
 Now the Lady arose , and Celeborn led words back to the hythe . A yellow noon lay on the green land of the Tongue , and the water glittered with silver . All at last was made ready . The Company took words places in the boats as before . Crying farewell , the Elves of Lórien with long grey poles thrust words out into the flowing stream , and the rippling waters bore words slowly away . The travellers sat still without moving or speaking . On the green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood alone and silent . As travellers passed Galadriel travellers turned and travellers eyes watched Galadriel slowly floating away from travellers . For so it seemed to travellers : Lórien was slipping backward , like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees , sailing on to forgotten shores , while travellers sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless world . 
 Even as travellers gazed , the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the Great River , and travellers boats turned and began to speed southward . Soon the white form of the Lady was small and distant . Lady shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun , or as a remote lake seen from a mountain : a crystal fallen in the lap of the land . Then it seemed to Frodo that Frodo lifted Frodo arms in a final farewell , and far but piercing - clear on the following wind came the sound of Frodo voice singing . But now Frodo sang in the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea , and River did not understand the words : fair was the music , but music did not comfort River . 
 Yet as is the way of Elvish words , words remained graven in River memory , and long afterwards River interpreted words , as well as River could : the language was that of Elven - song and spoke of things little known on Middle - earth . 
 Ai ! laurië lantar lassi súrinen , 
 yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron ! 
 Yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier 
 mi oromardi lisse - miruvóreva 
 Andúnë pella , Vardo tellumar 
 nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni 
 ómaryo airetári - lírinen . 
 Sí man i yulma nin enquantuva ? 
 An sí Tintallë Varda Oiolossëo 
 ve fanyar máryat Elentári ortanë , 
 ar ilyë tier undulávë lumbulë ; 
 ar sindanóriello caita mornië 
 i falmalinnar imbë met , ar hísië 
 untúpa Calaciryo míri oialë . 
 Sí vanwa ná , Rómello vanwa , Valimar ! 
 Namárië ! Nai hiruvalyë Valimar . 
 Nai elyë hiruva . Namárië ! 
 ‘ Ah ! like gold fall the leaves in the wind , long years numberless as the wings of trees ! The years have passed like swift draughts of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West , beneath the blue vaults of Varda wherein the stars tremble in the song of Varda voice , holy and queenly . Who now shall refill the cup for me ? For now the Kindler , Varda , the Queen of the Stars , from Mount Everwhite has uplifted Queen hands like clouds , and all paths are drowned deep in shadow ; and out of a grey country darkness lies on the foaming waves between us , and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for ever . Now lost , lost to those from the East is Valimar ! Farewell ! 
 Maybe thou shalt find Valimar . Maybe even thou shalt find thou . Farewell ! ’ Varda is the name of that Lady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth . 
 Suddenly the River swept round a bend , and the banks rose upon either side , and the light of Lórien was hidden . To that fair land Frodo never came again . 
 The travellers now turned travellers faces to the journey ; the sun was before travellers , and travellers eyes were dazzled , for all were filled with tears . Gimli wept openly . 
 ‘ I have looked the last upon that which was fairest , ’ Gimli said to Legolas Gimli companion . ‘ Henceforward I will call nothing fair , unless Henceforward be Legolas gift . ’ Gimli put Gimli hand to Gimli breast . 
 ‘ Tell me , Legolas , why did I come on this Quest ? Little did I know where the chief peril lay ! Truly Elrond spoke , saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road . Torment in the dark was the danger that I feared , and Torment did not hold me back . But I would not have come , had I known the danger of light and joy . Now I have taken my worst wound in this parting , even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord . Alas for Gimli son of Glóin ! ’ 
 ‘ Nay ! ’ said Legolas . ‘ Alas for us all ! And for all that walk the world in these after - days . For such is the way of all : to find and lose , as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream . But I count you blessed , Gimli son of Glóin : for your loss you suffer of your own free will , and you might have chosen otherwise . But you have not forsaken your companions , and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Lothlórien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart , and shall neither fade nor grow stale . ’ 
 ‘ Maybe , ’ said Gimli ; ‘ and I thank you for your words . True words doubtless ; yet all such comfort is cold . Memory is not what the heart desires . That is only a mirror , be That clear as Kheled - zâram . Or so says the heart of Gimli the Dwarf . Elves may see things otherwise . Indeed I have heard that for Elves memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream . Not so for Dwarves . 
 ‘ But let us talk no more of dream . Look to the boat ! world is too low in the water with all this baggage , and the Great River is swift . I do not wish to drown my grief in cold water . ’ River took up a paddle , and steered towards the western bank , following Aragorn ’s boat ahead , which had already moved out of the middle stream . 
 So the Aragorn went on baggage long way , down the wide hurrying waters , borne ever southwards . Bare woods stalked along either bank , and woods could not see any glimpse of the lands behind . The breeze died away and the River flowed without a sound . No voice of bird broke the silence . The sun grew misty as the day grew old , until sun gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl . Then sun faded into the West , and dusk came early , followed by a grey and starless night . Far into the dark quiet hours hours floated on , guiding hours boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods . Great trees passed by like ghosts , thrusting trees twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the water . water was dreary and cold . Frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree - roots and driftwood near the shore , until River head nodded and River fell into an uneasy sleep . 
 Chapter 9 
 THE GREAT RIVER 
 Frodo was roused by Sam . River found that River was lying , well wrapped , under tall grey - skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the Great River , Anduin . River had slept the night away , and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches . Gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand . 
 branches started again before the day was broad . Not that most of the Company were eager to hurry southwards : branches were content that the decision , which branches must make at latest when branches came to Rauros and the Tindrock Isle , still lay some days ahead ; and branches let the River bear branches on at decision own pace , having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond , whichever course branches took in the end . Aragorn let branches drift with the stream as branches wished , husbanding branches strength against weariness to come . But River insisted that at least branches should start early each day and journey on far into the evening ; for River felt in River heart that time was pressing , and River feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while Lord lingered in Lórien . 
 Nonetheless Lord saw no sign of any enemy that day , nor the next . The dull grey hours passed without event . As the third day of hours voyage wore on the lands changed slowly : the trees thinned and then failed altogether . On the eastern bank to hours left hours saw long formless slopes stretching up and away towards the sky ; brown and withered hours looked , as if fire had passed over hours , leaving no living blade of green : an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness . hours had come to the Brown Lands that lay , vast and desolate , between Southern Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil . What pestilence or war or evil deed of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell . 
 Upon the west to pestilence right the land was treeless also , but land was flat , and in many places green with wide plains of grass . On this side of the River pestilence passed forests of great reeds , so tall that pestilence shut out all view to the west , as the little boats went rustling by along boats fluttering borders . boats dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs , hissing softly and sadly . Here and there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads , and far beyond boats hills in the sunset , and away on the edge of sight a dark line , where marched the southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains . 
 There was no sign of living moving things , save birds . Of these there were many : small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds , but reeds were seldom seen . Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swan - wings , and looking up travellers saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky . 
 ‘ Swans ! ’ said Sam . ‘ And mighty big ones too ! ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Aragorn , ‘ and ones are black swans . ’ 
 ‘ How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ I always imagined that as one journeyed south one got warmer and merrier , until winter was left behind for ever . ’ 
 ‘ But we have not journeyed far south yet , ’ answered Aragorn . ‘ one is still winter , and we are far from the sea . Here the world is cold until the sudden spring , and we may yet have snow again . Far away down in the Bay of Belfalas , to which Anduin runs , Anduin is warm and merry , maybe , or would be but for the Enemy . But here we are not above sixty leagues , I guess , south of the Southfarthing away in your Shire , hundreds of long miles yonder . You are looking now south - west across the north plains of the Riddermark , Rohan the land of the Horse - lords . Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight that runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River . That is the north boundary of Rohan ; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim . That is a rich and pleasant land , and That grass has no rival ; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or ride often to folk shores . Anduin is wide , yet the orcs can shoot orcs arrows far across the stream ; and of late , Anduin is said , orcs have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan . ’ 
 Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily . The trees had seemed hostile before , as if trees harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers ; now Sam wished that the trees were still there . Sam felt that the Company was too naked , afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands , and on a river that was the frontier of war . 
 In the next day or two , as lands went on , borne steadily southwards , this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company . For a whole day lands took to lands paddles and hastened forward . The banks slid by . Soon the River broadened and grew more shallow ; long stony beaches lay upon the east , and there were gravel - shoals in the water , so that careful steering was needed . The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds , over which flowed a chill air from the East . On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock . Frodo shivered , thinking of the lawns and fountains , the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlórien . There was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats . Each member of the Company was busy with River own thoughts . 
 The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech - woods ; Gimli was fingering gold in River mind , and wondering if Gimli were fit to be wrought into the housing of the Lady ’s gift . Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease , for Boromir sat muttering to Boromir , sometimes biting Boromir nails , as if some restlessness or doubt consumed Boromir , sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn ’s . Then Pippin , who sat in the bow looking back , caught a queer gleam in Pippin eye , as Pippin peered forward gazing at Frodo . Sam had long ago made up Sam mind that , though boats were maybe not as dangerous as Sam had been brought up to believe , boats were far more uncomfortable than even Sam had imagined . Sam was cramped and miserable , having nothing to do but stare at the winter - lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of Pippin . Even when the paddles were in use paddles did not trust Sam with one . 
 As dusk drew down on the fourth day , Sam was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats ; Sam was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under Sam toes . Suddenly something caught Sam sight : at first Sam stared at something listlessly , then Sam sat up and rubbed Sam eyes ; but when Sam looked again Sam could not see something any more . 
 That night eyes camped on a small eyot close to the western bank . Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo . ‘ I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped , Mr. Frodo , ’ Sam said . ‘ Or maybe dream was n’t a dream . Funny dream was anyway . ’ 
 ‘ Well , what was dream ? ’ said Frodo , knowing that Sam would not settle down until Sam had told Sam tale , whatever tale was . ‘ I have n’t seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlórien . ’ 
 ‘ Lothlórien was n’t funny that way , Mr. Frodo . Lothlórien was queer . All wrong , if Lothlórien was n’t a dream . And you had best hear Lothlórien . Lothlórien was like this : I saw a log with eyes ! ’ 
 ‘ The log ’s all right , ’ said Frodo . ‘ There are many in the River . But leave out the eyes ! ’ 
 ‘ That I wo n’t , ’ said Sam . ‘ ’ Twas the eyes as made me sit up , so to speak . I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half - light behind Gimli ’s boat ; but I did n’t give much heed to boat . Then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up . And that was peculiar , as you might say , seeing as we were all floating on the stream together . Just then I saw the eyes : two pale sort of points , shiny - like , on a hump at the near end of the log . What ’s more , it was n’t a log , for log had paddle - feet , like a swan ’s almost , only feet seemed bigger , and kept dipping in and out of the water . 
 ‘ That ’s when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes , meaning to give a shout , if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head . For the whatever - drowse - was was coming along fast now and getting close behind Gimli . But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring , or whether I came to my senses , I do n’t know . When I looked again , it was n’t there . Yet I think I caught a glimpse , with the tail of my eye , as the saying is , of something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank . I could n’t see no more eyes , though . 
 ‘ I said to myself : “ dreaming again , Sam Gamgee , ” I said ; and I said no more just then . But I ’ve been thinking since , and now I ’m not so sure . What do you make of no , Mr. Frodo ? ’ 
 ‘ I should make nothing of no but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes , Sam , ’ said Frodo , ‘ if this was the first time that those eyes had been seen . But this is n’t . I saw eyes away back north before we reached Lórien . And I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night . Haldir saw creature too . And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the orc - band ? ’ 
 ‘ Ah , ’ said Sam , ‘ I do ; and I remember more too . I do n’t like my thoughts ; but thinking of one thing and another , and Mr. Bilbo ’s stories and all , I fancy I could put a name on the creature , at a guess . A nasty name . Gollum , maybe ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , that is what I have feared for some time , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Ever since the night on the flet . I suppose Gollum was lurking in Moria , and picked up our trail then ; but I hoped that our stay in Lórien would throw Gollum off the scent again . The miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods by the Silverlode , watching us start off ! ’ 
 ‘ That ’s about Silverlode , ’ said Sam . ‘ And we ’d better be a bit more watchful ourselves , or we ’ll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights , if we ever wake up to feel anything . And that ’s what I was leading up to . No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight . I ’ll keep watch . I can sleep tomorrow , being no more than luggage in a boat , as you might say . ’ 
 ‘ I might , ’ said Frodo , ‘ and I might say “ luggage with eyes ” . You shall watch ; but only if you promise to wake me half - way towards morning , if nothing happens before then . ’ 
 In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam shaking Strider . ‘ nothing ’s a shame to wake you , ’ whispered Sam , ‘ but that ’s what you said . There ’s nothing to tell , or not much . I thought I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise , a while back ; but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at night . ’ 
 Sam lay down , and Frodo sat up , huddled in Sam blankets , and fought off Sam sleep . Minutes or hours passed slowly , and nothing happened . Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape , hardly visible , floated close to one of the moored boats . A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as hand shot out and grabbed the gunwale ; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as eyes peered inside , and then eyes lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the eyot . eyes were not more than a yard or two away , and Frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath . Frodo stood up , drawing Sting from hiss sheath , and faced the eyes . Immediately eyes light was shut off . There was another hiss and a splash , and the dark log - shape shot away downstream into the night . Aragorn stirred in Aragorn sleep , turned over , and sat up . 
 ‘ What is sleep ? ’ Aragorn whispered , springing up and coming to Frodo . ‘ I felt something in my sleep . Why have you drawn your sword ? ’ 
 ‘ Gollum , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ Or at least , so I guess . ’ 
 ‘ Ah ! ’ said Aragorn . ‘ So you know about our little footpad , do you ? footpad padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel . Since we took to boats , footpad has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet . I have tried to catch footpad once or twice at night ; but footpad is slier than a fox , and as slippery as a fish . I hoped the river - voyage would beat footpad , but footpad is too clever a waterman . 
 ‘ We shall have to try going faster tomorrow . You lie down now , and I will keep watch for what is left of the night . I wish 
 I could lay my hands on the wretch . We might make wretch useful . But if I can not , we shall have to try and lose wretch . wretch is very dangerous . Quite apart from murder by night on wretch own account , wretch may put any enemy that is about on our track . ’ 
 The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again . After that the Company kept a sharp look - out , but shadow saw no more of Gollum while the voyage lasted . If Gollum was still following , Gollum was very wary and cunning . At Aragorn ’s bidding shadow paddled now for long spells , and the banks went swiftly by . But shadow saw little of the country , for shadow journeyed mostly by night and twilight , resting by day , and lying as hidden as the land allowed . In this way the time passed without event until the seventh day . 
 The weather was still grey and overcast , with wind from the East , but as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared , and pools of faint light , yellow and pale green , opened under the grey shores of cloud . There the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes . Sam looked at rind and puckered Sam brows . 
 The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly . The banks began to rise and grow stony . Soon banks were passing through a hilly rocky land , and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe , tangled with brambles and creepers . Behind banks stood low crumbling cliffs , and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy ; and beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind - writhen firs . banks were drawing near to the grey hill - country of the Emyn Muil , the southern march of Wilderland . 
 There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock - chimneys , and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling , black against the pale sky . As flights lay in flights camp that day Aragorn watched the flights doubtfully , wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of flights voyage was now moving in the wilderness . Later as the sun was setting , and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again , Aragorn descried a dark spot against the fading light : a great bird high and far off , now wheeling , now flying on slowly southwards . 
 ‘ What is that , Legolas ? ’ Aragorn asked , pointing to the northern sky . ‘ Is it , as I think , an eagle ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Legolas . ‘ eagle is an eagle , a hunting eagle . I wonder what that forebodes . eagle is far from the mountains . ’ 
 ‘ We will not start until eagle is fully dark , ’ said Aragorn . 
 The eighth night of Aragorn journey came . night was silent and windless ; the grey east wind had passed away . The thin crescent of the Moon had fallen early into the pale sunset , but the sky was clear above , and though far away in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly , in the West stars glinted bright . 
 ‘ Come ! ’ said Aragorn . ‘ We will venture one more journey by night . We are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well ; for I have never journeyed by water in these parts before , not between here and the rapids of Sarn Gebir . But if I am right in my reckoning , those are still many miles ahead . Still there are dangerous places even before we come there : rocks and stony eyots in the stream . We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly . ’ 
 To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman . Sam lay forward peering into the gloom . The night grew dark , but the stars above were strangely bright , and there was a glimmer on the face of the River . night was close on midnight , and stars had been drifting for some while , hardly using the paddles , when suddenly Sam cried out . Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and Sam heard the swirl of racing water . There was a swift current which swung left , towards the eastern shore where the channel was clear . As travellers were swept aside the travellers could see , now very close , the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth . The boats were all huddled together . 
 ‘ Hoy there , Aragorn ! ’ shouted Boromir , as Boromir boat bumped into the leader . ‘ This is madness ! We can not dare the Rapids by night ! But no boat can live in Sarn Gebir , be boat night or day . ’ 
 ‘ Back , back ! ’ cried Aragorn . ‘ Turn ! Turn if you can ! ’ Aragorn drove Aragorn paddle into the water , trying to hold the boat and bring boat round . 
 ‘ I am out of my reckoning , ’ Aragorn said to Frodo . ‘ I did not know that we had come so far : Anduin flows faster than I thought . Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already . ’ 
 With great efforts Gebir checked the boats and slowly brought boats about ; but at first boats could make only small headway against the current , and all the time boats were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank . Now dark and ominous bank loomed up in the night . 
 ‘ All together , paddle ! ’ shouted Boromir . ‘ Paddle ! Or we shall be driven on the shoals . ’ Even as Frodo spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath Frodo grate upon stone . 
 At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings : several arrows whistled over bowstrings , and some fell among bowstrings . One smote Frodo between the shoulders and stone lurched forward with a cry , letting go stone paddle : but the arrow fell back , foiled by stone hidden coat of mail . Another passed through Aragorn ’s hood ; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat , close by Merry ’s hand . Sam thought Sam could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle - banks that lay under the eastern shore . banks seemed very near . 
 ‘ Yrch ! ’ said Legolas , falling into Legolas own tongue . 
 ‘ Orcs ! ’ cried Gimli . 
 ‘ Gollum ’s doing , I ’ll be bound , ’ said Sam to Frodo . ‘ And a nice place to choose , too . The River seems set on taking us right into River arms ! ’ 
 banks all leaned forward straining at the paddles : even Sam took a hand . Every moment banks expected to feel the bite of black - feathered arrows . Many whined overhead or struck the water nearby ; but there were no more hits . It was dark , but not too dark for the night - eyes of Orcs , and in the star - glimmer banks must have offered banks cunning foes some mark , unless it was that the grey cloaks of Lórien and the grey timber of the elf - wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor . 
 Stroke by stroke banks laboured on . In the darkness it was hard to be sure that banks were indeed moving at all ; but slowly the swirl of the water grew less , and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night . At last , as far as banks could judge , banks had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven banks boats back some distance above the jutting rocks . Then half turning banks thrust boats with all boats strength towards the western shore . Under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water boats halted and drew breath . 
 Legolas laid down Legolas paddle and took up the bow that shadow had brought from Lórien . Then Lórien sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank . Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow Lórien turned , peering back over the River into the darkness . Across the water there were shrill cries , but nothing could be seen . 
 Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above River , as River gazed into the night , seeking a mark to shoot at . River head was dark , crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind . But now rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced , sending out dark outriders into the starry fields . A sudden dread fell on the Company . 
 ‘ Elbereth Gilthoniel ! ’ sighed Legolas as River looked up . Even as River did so , a dark shape , like a cloud and yet not a cloud , for Legolas moved far more swiftly , came out of the blackness in the South , and sped towards the Company , blotting out all light as Legolas approached . Soon Legolas appeared as a great winged creature , blacker than the pits in the night . Fierce voices rose up to greet Legolas from across the water . Frodo felt a sudden chill running through River and clutching at River heart ; there was a deadly cold , like the memory of an old wound , in River shoulder . River crouched down , as if to hide . 
 Suddenly the great bow of Lórien sang . Shrill went the arrow from the elven - string . Frodo looked up . Almost above Frodo the winged shape swerved . There was a harsh croaking scream , as scream fell out of the air , vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore . The sky was clean again . There was a tumult of many voices far away , cursing and wailing in the darkness , and then silence . Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night . 
 After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream . boats felt boats way along the water ’s edge for some distance , until boats found a small shallow bay . A few low trees grew there close to the water , and behind boats rose a steep rocky bank . Here the Company decided to stay and await the dawn : it was useless to attempt to move further by night . boats made no camp and lit no fire , but lay huddled in the boats , moored close together . 
 ‘ Praised be the bow of Galadriel , and the hand and eye of Legolas ! ’ said Gimli , as Gimli munched a wafer of lembas . ‘ That was a mighty shot in the dark , my friend ! ’ 
 ‘ But who can say what That hit ? ’ said Legolas . 
 ‘ I can not , ’ said Gimli . ‘ But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer . I liked shadow not at all . Too much shadow reminded me of the shadow in Moria – the shadow of the Balrog , ’ Gimli ended in a whisper . 
 ‘ shadow was not a Balrog , ’ said Frodo , still shivering with the chill that had come upon Frodo . ‘ shadow was something colder . I think shadow was — — ’ Then Frodo paused and fell silent . 
 ‘ What do you think ? ’ asked Boromir eagerly , leaning from Boromir boat , as if Boromir was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo ’s face . 
 ‘ I think — No , I will not say , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ Whatever fall was , fall fall has dismayed our enemies . ’ 
 ‘ So it seems , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Yet where enemies are , and how many , and what enemies will do next , we do not know . This night we must all be sleepless ! Dark hides us now . But what the day will show who can tell ? Have your weapons close to hand ! ’ 
 Sam sat tapping the hilt of Sam sword as if Sam were counting on Sam fingers , and looking up at the sky . ‘ hand ’s very strange , ’ Sam murmured . ‘ The Moon ’s the same in the Shire and in Wilderland , or Shire ought to be . But either Shire ’s out of Shire running , or I ’m all wrong in my reckoning . You ’ll remember , Mr. Frodo , the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree : a week from the full , I reckon . And we ’d been a week on the way last night , when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail - paring , as if we had never stayed no time in the Elvish country . 
 ‘ Well , I can remember three nights there for certain , and I seem to remember several more , but I would take my oath oath was never a whole month . Anyone would think that time did not count in there ! ’ 
 ‘ And perhaps that was the way of time , ’ said Frodo . ‘ In that land , maybe , we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by . It was not , I think , until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea . And I do n’t remember any moon , either new or old , in Caras Galadhon : only stars by night and sun by day . ’ 
 Legolas stirred in Frodo boat . ‘ Nay , time does not tarry ever , ’ Frodo said ; ‘ but change and growth is not in all things and places alike . For the Elves the world moves , and world moves both very swift and very slow . Swift , because Elves Elves change little , and all else fleets by : it is a grief to Elves . Slow , because Elves need not count the running years , not for Elves . The passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream . Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last . ’ 
 ‘ But the wearing is slow in Lórien , ’ said Frodo . ‘ The power of the Lady is on Lórien . Rich are the hours , though short hours seem , in Caras Galadhon , where Galadriel wields the Elven - ring . ’ 
 ‘ That should not have been said outside Lórien , not even to me , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Speak no more of That ! But so it is , Sam : in that land you lost your count . There time flowed swiftly by us , as for the Elves . The old moon passed , and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside , while we tarried there . And yestereve a new moon came again . Winter is nearly gone . Time flows on to a spring of little hope . ’ 
 The night passed silently . No voice or call was heard again across the water . The travellers huddled in travellers boats felt the changing of the weather . The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the South and the distant seas . The rushing of the River over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer . The twigs of the trees above rocks began to drip . 
 When the day came the mood of the world about rocks had become soft and sad . Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light , diffused and shadowless . There was mist on the River , and white fog swathed the shore ; the far bank could not be seen . 
 ‘ I ca n’t abide fog , ’ said Sam ; ‘ but this seems to be a lucky one . Now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us . ’ 
 ‘ Perhaps so , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But it will be hard to find the path unless the fog lifts a little later on . And we must find the path , if we are to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil . ’ 
 ‘ I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any further , ’ said Boromir . ‘ If the Emyn Muil lie before us , then we can abandon these cockle - boats , and strike westward and southward , until we come to the Entwash and cross into my own land . ’ 
 ‘ We can , if we are making for Minas Tirith , ’ said Aragorn , ‘ but that is not yet agreed . And such a course may be more perilous than course sounds . The vale of Entwash is flat and fenny , and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden . I would not abandon our boats until we must . The River is at least a path that can not be missed . ’ 
 ‘ But the Enemy holds the eastern bank , ’ objected Boromir . ‘ And even if you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock , what will you do then ? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes ? ’ 
 ‘ No ! ’ answered Aragorn . ‘ Say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to Rauros - foot , and there take to the water again . Do you not know , Boromir , or do you choose to forget the North Stair , and the high seat upon Amon Hen , that were made in the days of the great kings ? I at least have a mind to stand in that high place again , before I decide my further course . There , maybe , we shall see some sign that will guide us . ’ 
 Boromir held out long against this choice ; but when choice became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn , wherever Frodo went , Frodo gave in . ‘ It is not the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert Men friends at need , ’ Frodo said , ‘ and you will need my strength , if ever you are to reach the Tindrock . To the tall isle I will go , but no further . There I shall turn to my home , alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship . ’ 
 The day was now growing , and the fog had lifted a little . It was decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the shore , while the others remained by the boats . Aragorn hoped to find some way by which others could carry both others boats and others baggage to the smoother water beyond the Rapids . 
 ‘ Boats of the Elves would not sink , maybe , ’ Aragorn said , ‘ but that does not say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive . None have ever done so yet . No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region , for even in Boats great days Boats realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil ; but there is a portage - way somewhere on the western shore , if I can find shore . shore can not yet have perished ; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland down to Osgiliath , and still did so until a few years ago , when the Orcs of Mordor began to multiply . ’ 
 ‘ Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North , and the Orcs prowl on the east - shore , ’ said Boromir . ‘ If you go forward , peril will grow with every mile , even if you find a path . ’ 
 ‘ Peril lies ahead on every southward road , ’ answered Aragorn . ‘ Wait for us one day . If we do not return in that time , you will know that evil has indeed befallen us . Then you must take a new leader and follow Muil as best you can . ’ 
 It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists ; but Aragorn fears proved groundless . Only two or three hours had passed , and it was barely mid - day , when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again . 
 ‘ All is well , ’ said Aragorn , as Aragorn clambered down the bank . ‘ There is a track , and track leads to a good landing that is still serviceable . The distance is not great : the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us , and Rapids are little more than a mile long . Not far beyond Rapids the stream becomes clear and smooth again , though stream runs swiftly . Our hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage - way . We have found stream , but stream lies well back from the water - side here , and runs under the lee of a rock - wall , a furlong or more from the shore . We did not find where the northward landing lies . If landing still remains , we must have passed landing yesterday night . We might labour far upstream and yet miss landing in the fog . I fear we must leave the River now , and make for the portage - way as best we can from here . ’ 
 ‘ That would not be easy , even if we were all Men , ’ said Boromir . 
 ‘ Yet such as we are we will try That , ’ said Aragorn . 
 ‘ Aye , we will , ’ said Gimli . ‘ The legs of Men will lag on a rough road , while a Dwarf goes on , be the burden twice River own weight , Master Boromir ! ’ 
 The task proved hard indeed , yet in the end task was done . The goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank , where there was a level space . Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up . boats were far less heavy than any had expected . Of what tree growing in the Elvish country boats were made not even Legolas knew ; but the wood was tough and yet strangely light . Merry and Pippin alone could carry Merry boat with ease along the flat . Nonetheless boat needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul Men over the ground that the Company now had to cross . Company sloped up away from the River , a tumbled waste of grey limestone - boulders , with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes ; there were thickets of brambles , and sheer dells ; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland . 
 One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats , while the others toiled and scrambled after boats with the baggage . At last all was removed and laid on the portage - way . Then with little further hindrance , save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones , briars moved forward all together . Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock - wall , and to briars left mist shrouded the River : briars could hear Fog rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir , but briars could not see Fog . Twice briars made the journey , before all was brought safe to the southern landing . 
 There the portage - way , turning back to the water - side , ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool . It seemed to have been scooped in the river - side , not by hand , but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream . Beyond rock the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff , and there was no further passage for those on foot . 
 Already the short afternoon was past , and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in . those sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the Rapids hidden in the mist ; those were tired and sleepy , and those hearts were as gloomy as the dying day . 
 ‘ Well , here we are , and here we must pass another night , ’ said Boromir . ‘ We need sleep , and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath by night , we are all too tired – except , no doubt , our sturdy dwarf . ’ 
 Gimli made no reply : Boromir was nodding as Boromir sat . 
 ‘ Let us rest as much as we can now , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Tomorrow we must journey by day again . Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us , we shall have a good chance of slipping through , unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore . But tonight two must watch together in turns : three hours off and one on guard . ’ 
 Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before dawn . As soon as Nothing was fully light two started . Already the fog was thinning . two kept as close as two could to the western side , and two could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher , shadowy walls with two feet in the hurrying river . In the mid - morning the clouds drew down lower , and it began to rain heavily . clouds drew the skin - covers over clouds boats to prevent covers from being flooded , and drifted on ; little could be seen before covers or about covers through the grey falling curtains . 
 The rain , however , did not last long . Slowly the sky above grew lighter , and then suddenly the clouds broke , and clouds draggled fringes trailed away northward up the River . The fogs and mists were gone . Before the travellers lay a wide ravine , with great rocky sides to which clung , upon shelves and in narrow crevices , a few thrawn trees . The channel grew narrower and the River swifter . Now travellers were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning , whatever travellers might meet ahead . Over travellers was a lane of pale - blue sky , around travellers the dark overshadowed River , and before travellers black , shutting out the sun , the hills of Emyn Muil , in which no opening could be seen . 
 Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching : like great pinnacles or pillars of stone rocks seemed . Tall and sheer and ominous rocks stood upon either side of the stream . A narrow gap appeared between rocks , and the River swept the boats towards gap . 
 ‘ Behold the Argonath , the Pillars of the Kings ! ’ cried Aragorn . ‘ We shall pass Kings soon . Keep the boats in line , and as far apart as you can ! Hold the middle of the stream ! ’ 
 As Frodo was borne towards pillars the great pillars rose like towers to meet Aragorn . Giants Giants seemed to Aragorn , vast grey figures silent but threatening . Then Aragorn saw that Giants were indeed shaped and fashioned : the craft and power of old had wrought upon Giants , and still Giants preserved through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which Giants had been hewn . Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone : still with blurred eyes and crannied brows kings frowned upon the North . The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in gesture of warning ; in each right hand there was an axe ; upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown . Great power and majesty power still wore , the silent wardens of a long - vanished kingdom . Awe and fear fell upon Frodo , and Frodo cowered down , shutting Frodo eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew near . Even Boromir bowed Frodo head as the boats whirled by , frail and fleeting as little leaves , under the enduring shadow of the sentinels of Númenor . So boats passed into the dark chasm of the Gates . 
 Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side . Far off was the dim sky . The black waters roared and echoed , and a wind screamed over waters . Frodo crouching over Frodo knees heard Sam in front muttering and groaning : ‘ What a place ! What a horrible place ! Just let me get out of this boat , and I ’ll never wet my toes in a puddle again , let alone a river ! ’ 
 ‘ Fear not ! ’ said a strange voice behind Frodo . Frodo turned and saw Strider , and yet not Strider ; for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer there . In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn , proud and erect , guiding the boat with skilful strokes ; Ranger hood was cast back , and Ranger dark hair was blowing in the wind , a light was in Ranger eyes : a king returning from exile to Ranger own land . 
 ‘ Fear not ! ’ Ranger said . ‘ Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anárion , my sires of old . Under Isildur shadow Elessar , the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur ’s son , heir of Elendil , has naught to dread ! ’ 
 Then the light of Ranger eyes faded , and Ranger spoke to Ranger : ‘ Would that Gandalf were here ! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor and the walls of my own city ! But whither now shall I go ? ’ 
 The chasm was long and dark , and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone . chasm bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead ; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before Ranger , ever growing . Swiftly Frodo drew near , and suddenly the boats shot through , out into a wide clear light . 
 The sun , already long fallen from the noon , was shining in a windy sky . The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake , pale Nen Hithoel , fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees , but waters heads were bare , cold - gleaming in the sunlight . At the far southern end rose three peaks . The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from others , an island in the waters , about which the flowing River flung pale shimmering arms . Distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far away . 
 ‘ Behold Tol Brandir ! ’ said Aragorn , pointing south to the tall peak . ‘ Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw , and upon the right is Amon Hen , the Hills of Hearing and of Sight . In the days of the great kings there were high seats upon Hen , and watch was kept there . But it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir . Ere the shade of night falls we shall come to foot . I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling . ’ 
 The Company rested now for a while , drifting south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake . Company ate some food , and then foot took to foot paddles and hastened on foot way . The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow , and the Sun grew round and red . Here and there a misty star peered out . The three peaks loomed before star , darkling in the twilight . Rauros was roaring with a great voice . Already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills . 
 The tenth day of travellers journey was over . Wilderland was behind travellers . travellers could go no further without choice between the east - way and the west . The last stage of the Quest was before travellers . 
 Chapter 10 
 THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP 
 Aragorn led travellers to the right arm of the River . Here upon Aragorn western side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen . Behind Aragorn rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees , and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of the lake . A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass . 
 ‘ Here we will rest tonight , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ This is the lawn of Parth Galen : a fair place in the summer days of old . Let us hope that no evil has yet come here . ’ 
 trees drew up trees boats on the green banks , and beside trees boats made boats camp . boats set a watch , but had no sight nor sound of boats enemies . If Gollum had contrived to follow boats , Gollum remained unseen and unheard . Nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy , tossing often in Aragorn sleep and waking . In the small hours Aragorn got up and came to Frodo , whose turn it was to watch . 
 ‘ Why are you waking ? ’ asked Frodo . ‘ turn is not your watch . ’ 
 ‘ I do not know , ’ answered Aragorn ; ‘ but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep . It would be well to draw your sword . ’ 
 ‘ Why ? ’ said Frodo . ‘ Are enemies at hand ? ’ 
 ‘ Let us see what Sting may show , ’ answered Aragorn . 
 Frodo then drew the elf - blade from blade sheath . To Aragorn dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night . ‘ Orcs ! ’ Aragorn said . ‘ Not very near , and yet too near , it seems . ’ 
 ‘ I feared as much , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But maybe Orcs are not on this side of the River . The light of Sting is faint , and light may point to no more than spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw . I have never heard before of Orcs upon Amon Hen . Yet who knows what may happen in these evil days , now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin . We must go warily tomorrow . ’ 
 The day came like fire and smoke . Low in the East there were black bars of cloud like the fumes of a great burning . The rising sun lit fumes from beneath with flames of murky red ; but soon sun climbed above fumes into a clear sky . The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold . Frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island . Frodo sides sprang sheer out of the running water . High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed , mounting one head above another ; and above trees again were grey faces of inaccessible rock , crowned by a great spire of stone . Many birds were circling about rock , but no sign of other living things could be seen . 
 When birds had eaten , Aragorn called the Company together . ‘ The day has come at last , ’ Aragorn said : ‘ the day of choice which we have long delayed . What shall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship ? Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor ; or turn east to the Fear and Shadow ; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may choose ? Whatever we do must be done soon . We can not long halt here . The enemy is on the eastern shore , we know ; but I fear that the Orcs may already be on this side of the water . ’ 
 There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved . 
 ‘ Well , Frodo , ’ said Aragorn at last . ‘ I fear that the burden is laid upon you . You are the Bearer appointed by the Council . Your own way you alone can choose . In this matter I can not advise you . I am not Gandalf , and though I have tried to bear Gandalf part , I do not know what design or hope Council had for this hour , if indeed Bearer had any . Most likely it seems that if Bearer were here now the choice would still wait on you . Such is your fate . ’ 
 Frodo did not answer at once . Then Frodo spoke slowly . ‘ I know that haste is needed , yet I can not choose . The burden is heavy . Give me an hour longer , and I will speak . Let me be alone ! ’ 
 Aragorn looked at Frodo with kindly pity . ‘ Very well , Frodo son of Drogo , ’ son said . ‘ You shall have an hour , and you shall be alone . We will stay here for a while . But do not stray far or out of call . ’ 
 Frodo sat for a moment with Frodo head bowed . Sam , who had been watching Sam master with great concern , shook Sam head and muttered : ‘ Plain as a pikestaff call is , but call ’s no good Sam Gamgee putting in Gamgee spoke just now . ’ 
 Presently Frodo got up and walked away ; and Sam saw that while the others restrained others and did not stare at Sam , the eyes of Boromir followed Frodo intently , until Sam passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of Amon Hen . 
 Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood , Frodo found that Sam feet were leading Sam up towards the slopes of the hill . Sam came to a path , the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago . In steep places stairs of stone had been hewn , but now stairs were cracked and worn , and split by the roots of trees . For some while Sam climbed , not caring which way Sam went , until Sam came to a grassy place . Rowan - trees grew about some , and in the midst was a wide flat stone . The little upland lawn was open upon the East and was filled now with the early sunlight . Frodo halted and looked out over the River , far below Sam , to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between Sam and the untrodden isle . The voice of Rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom . 
 Rauros sat down upon the stone and cupped Rauros chin in Rauros hands , staring eastwards but seeing little with Rauros eyes . All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through Bilbo mind , and Bilbo recalled and pondered everything that Bilbo could remember of Gandalf ’s words . Time went on , and still Bilbo was no nearer to a choice . 
 Suddenly Bilbo awoke from Bilbo thoughts : a strange feeling came to Bilbo that something was behind Bilbo , that unfriendly eyes were upon Bilbo . Bilbo sprang up and turned ; but all that Bilbo saw to Bilbo surprise was Boromir , and Bilbo face was smiling and kind . 
 ‘ I was afraid for you , Frodo , ’ Bilbo said , coming forward . ‘ If Aragorn is right and Orcs are near , then none of us should wander alone , and you least of all : so much depends on you . And my heart too is heavy . May I stay now and talk for a while , since I have found you ? while would comfort me . Where there are so many , all speech becomes a debate without end . But two together may perhaps find wisdom . ’ 
 ‘ You are kind , ’ answered Frodo . ‘ But I do not think that any speech will help me . For I know what I should do , but I am afraid of doing speech , Boromir : afraid . ’ 
 Boromir stood silent . Rauros roared endlessly on . The wind murmured in the branches of the trees . Frodo shivered . 
 Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside Frodo . ‘ Are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly ? ’ Frodo said . ‘ I wish to help you . You need counsel in your hard choice . Will you not take mine ? ’ 
 ‘ I think I know already what counsel you would give , Boromir , ’ said Frodo . ‘ And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart . ’ 
 ‘ Warning ? Warning against what ? ’ said Boromir sharply . 
 ‘ Against delay . Against the way that seems easier . Against refusal of the burden that is laid on me . Against – well , if refusal must be said , against trust in the strength and truth of Men . ’ 
 ‘ Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country , though you knew country not . ’ 
 ‘ I do not doubt the valour of your people . But the world is changing . The walls of Minas Tirith may be strong , but walls are not strong enough . If walls fail , what then ? ’ 
 ‘ We shall fall in battle valiantly . Yet there is still hope that walls will not fail . ’ 
 ‘ No hope while the Ring lasts , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ Ah ! The Ring ! ’ said Boromir , Boromir eyes lighting . ‘ The Ring ! Is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing ? So small a thing ! And I have seen thing only for an instant in the house of Elrond . Could I not have a sight of thing again ? ’ 
 Frodo looked up . Frodo heart went suddenly cold . Elrond caught the strange gleam in Boromir ’s eyes , yet Elrond face was still kind and friendly . ‘ It is best that thing should lie hidden , ’ Elrond answered . 
 ‘ As you wish . I care not , ’ said Boromir . ‘ Yet may I not even speak of thing ? For you seem ever to think only of thing power in the hands of the Enemy : of thing evil uses not of thing good . The world is changing , you say . Minas Tirith will fall , if the Ring lasts . But why ? Certainly , if the Ring were with the Enemy . But why , if Ring were with us ? ’ 
 ‘ Were you not at the Council ? ’ answered Frodo . ‘ Because we can not use Ring , and what is done with Ring turns to evil . ’ 
 Boromir got up and walked about impatiently . ‘ So you go on , ’ Frodo cried . ‘ Gandalf , Elrond – all these folk have taught you to say so . For Gandalf Elrond may be right . These elves and half - elves and wizards , Boromir would come to grief perhaps . Yet often I doubt if elves are wise and not merely timid . But each to Frodo own kind . True - hearted Men , elves will not be corrupted . We of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial . We do not desire the power of wizard - lords , only strength to defend ourselves , strength in a just cause . And behold ! in our need chance brings to light the Ring of Power . chance is a gift , I say ; a gift to the foes of Mordor . It is mad not to use chance , to use the power of the Enemy against Mordor . The fearless , the ruthless , these alone will achieve victory . What could not a warrior do in this hour , a great leader ? What could not Aragorn do ? Or if warrior refuses , why not Boromir ? The Ring would give me power of Command . How I would drive the hosts of Mordor , and all men would flock to my banner ! ’ 
 Boromir strode up and down , speaking ever more loudly . Almost warrior seemed to have forgotten Frodo , while warrior talk dwelt on walls and weapons , and the mustering of men ; and warrior drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be ; and warrior cast down Mordor , and became warrior a mighty king , benevolent and wise . Suddenly warrior stopped and waved warrior arms . 
 ‘ And men tell us to throw banner away ! ’ warrior cried . ‘ I do not say destroy banner . That might be well , if reason could show any hope of doing so . That does not . The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing Enemy for Mordor . Folly ! 
 ‘ Surely you see Enemy , my friend ? ’ Folly said , turning now suddenly to Frodo again . ‘ You say that you are afraid . If Enemy is so , the boldest should pardon you . But is it not really your good sense that revolts ? ’ 
 ‘ No , I am afraid , ’ said Frodo . ‘ Simply afraid . But I am glad to have heard you speak so fully . My mind is clearer now . ’ 
 ‘ Then you will come to Minas Tirith ? ’ cried Boromir . Boromir eyes were shining and Boromir face eager . 
 ‘ You misunderstand me , ’ said Frodo . 
 ‘ But you will come , at least for a while ? ’ Boromir persisted . ‘ My city is not far now ; and city is little further from there to Mordor than from here . We have been long in the wilderness , and you need news of what the Enemy is doing before you make a move . Come with me , Frodo , ’ Enemy said . ‘ You need rest before your venture , if go you must . ’ Boromir laid Mordor hand on the hobbit ’s shoulder in friendly fashion ; but Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement . Frodo stepped quickly away , and eyed with alarm the tall Frodo , nearly twice Frodo height and many times Frodo match in strength . 
 ‘ Why are you so unfriendly ? ’ said Boromir . ‘ I am a true man , neither thief nor tracker . I need your Ring : that you know now ; but I give you my word that I do not desire to keep word . Will you not at least let me make trial of my plan ? Lend me the Ring ! ’ 
 ‘ No ! no ! ’ cried Frodo . ‘ The Council laid trial upon me to bear trial . ’ 
 ‘ It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us , ’ cried Boromir . ‘ How Enemy angers me ! Fool ! Obstinate fool ! Running wilfully to death and ruining our cause . If any mortals have claim to the Ring , it is the men of Númenor , and not Halflings . It is not yours save by unhappy chance . chance might have been mine . chance should be mine . Give chance to me ! ’ 
 Frodo did not answer , but moved away till the great flat stone stood between Frodo . ‘ Come , come , my friend ! ’ said Boromir in a softer voice . ‘ Why not get rid of chance ? Why not be free of your doubt and fear ? You can lay the blame on me , if you will . You can say that I was too strong and took blame by force . For I am too strong for you , halfling , ’ Boromir cried ; and suddenly Boromir sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo . Boromir fair and pleasant face was hideously changed ; a raging fire was in Boromir eyes . 
 Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between eyes . There was only one thing Frodo could do : trembling Boromir pulled out the Ring upon Ring chain and quickly slipped Ring on Boromir finger , even as Boromir sprang at Frodo again . The Boromir gasped , stared for a moment amazed , and then ran wildly about , seeking here and there among the rocks and trees . 
 ‘ Miserable trickster ! ’ Frodo shouted . ‘ Let me get my hands on you ! Now I see your mind . You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all . You have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch . Curse you and all halflings to death and darkness ! ’ Then , catching Sauron foot on a stone , foot fell sprawling and lay upon mind face . For a while face was as still as if face own curse had struck face down ; then suddenly face wept . 
 face rose and passed face hand over face eyes , dashing away the tears . ‘ What have I said ? ’ face cried . ‘ What have I done ? Frodo , Frodo ! ’ face called . ‘ Come back ! A madness took me , but madness has passed . Come back ! ’ 
 There was no answer . Frodo did not even hear Frodo cries . Frodo was already far away , leaping blindly up the path to the hill - top . Terror and grief shook Frodo , seeing in Frodo thought the mad fierce face of Boromir , and Frodo burning eyes . 
 Soon Frodo came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen , and halted , gasping for breath . Frodo saw as through a mist a wide flat circle , paved with mighty flags , and surrounded with a crumbling battlement ; and in the middle , set upon four carven pillars , was a high seat , reached by a stair of many steps . Up Frodo went and sat upon the ancient chair , feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain - kings . 
 At first Frodo could see little . Frodo seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows : the Ring was upon Frodo . Then here and there the mist gave way and Frodo saw many visions : small and clear as if visions were under Frodo eyes upon a table , and yet remote . There was no sound , only bright living images . The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent . world was sitting upon the Seat of Seeing , on Amon Hen , the Hill of the Eye of the Men of Númenor . Eastward world looked into wide uncharted lands , nameless plains , and forests unexplored . Northward world looked , and the Great River lay like a ribbon beneath world , and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth . Westward world looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan ; and Orthanc , the pinnacle of Isengard , like a black spike . Southward world looked , and below world very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit ; a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume . And Ethir Anduin world saw , the mighty delta of the River , and myriads of sea - birds whirling like a white dust in the sun , and beneath feet a green and silver sea , rippling in endless lines . 
 But everywhere world looked world saw the signs of war . The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills : orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes . Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and fell beasts . The land of the Beornings was aflame ; a cloud was over Moria ; smoke rose on the borders of Lórien . 
 Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan ; wolves poured from Isengard . From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea ; and out of the East Men were moving endlessly : swordsmen , spearmen , bowmen upon horses , chariots of chieftains and laden wains . All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion . Then turning south again Rohan beheld Minas Tirith . Far away it seemed , and beautiful : white - walled , many - towered , proud and fair upon Tirith mountain - seat ; Tirith battlements glittered with steel , and Tirith turrets were bright with many banners . Hope leaped in Rohan heart . But against Minas Tirith was set another fortress , greater and more strong . Thither , eastward , unwilling Rohan eye was drawn . Thither passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath , the grinning gates of Minas Morgul , and the haunted Mountains , and Thither looked upon Gorgoroth , the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor . Darkness lay there under the Sun . Fire glowed amid the smoke . Mount Doom was burning , and a great reek rising . Then at last Gorgoroth gaze was held : wall upon wall , battlement upon battlement , black , immeasurably strong , mountain of iron , gate of steel , tower of adamant , Gorgoroth saw gaze : Barad - dûr , Fortress of Sauron . All hope left Gorgoroth . 
 And suddenly Gorgoroth felt the Eye . There was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep . Gorgoroth knew that Tower had become aware of Gorgoroth gaze . A fierce eager will was there . Tower leaped towards Gorgoroth ; almost like a finger Gorgoroth felt Tower , searching for him . Very soon Tower would nail him down , know just exactly where Gorgoroth was . Amon Lhaw Tower touched . Tower glanced upon Tol Brandir – Gorgoroth threw Gorgoroth from the seat , crouching , covering Gorgoroth head with Gorgoroth grey hood . 
 Gorgoroth heard Gorgoroth crying out : Never , never ! Or was Tower : Verily I come , I come to you ? Gorgoroth could not tell . Then as a flash from some other point of power there came to Gorgoroth mind another thought : Take flash off ! Take flash off ! Fool , take flash off ! Take off the Ring ! 
 The two powers strove in Gorgoroth . For a moment , perfectly balanced between powers piercing points , Gorgoroth writhed , tormented . Suddenly Gorgoroth was aware of Gorgoroth again , Frodo , neither the Voice nor the Eye : free to choose , and with one remaining instant in which to do so . Gorgoroth took the Ring off Gorgoroth finger . Gorgoroth was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat . A black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above Gorgoroth ; it missed Amon Hen and groped out west , and faded . Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree . 
 Frodo rose to Gorgoroth feet . A great weariness was on Gorgoroth , but Gorgoroth will was firm and Gorgoroth heart lighter . Gorgoroth spoke aloud to Gorgoroth . ‘ I will do now what I must , ’ Gorgoroth said . ‘ This at least is plain : the evil of the Ring is already at work even in the Ring , and the Ring must leave Frodo before Ring does more harm . I will go alone . Some I can not trust , and those I can trust are too dear to me : poor old Sam , and Merry and Pippin . Strider , too : Sam heart yearns for Minas Tirith , and Sam will be needed there , now Boromir has fallen into evil . I will go alone . At once . ’ 
 Sam went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir had found Boromir . Then Boromir halted , listening . Boromir thought Boromir could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below . 
 ‘ woods ’ll be hunting for me , ’ Boromir said . ‘ I wonder how long I have been away . Hours , I should think . ’ Boromir hesitated . ‘ What can I do ? ’ Boromir muttered . ‘ I must go now or I shall never go . I sha n’t get a chance again . I hate leaving them , and like this without any explanation . But surely them will understand . Sam will . And what else can I do ? ’ 
 Slowly Sam drew out the Ring and put Ring on once more . Sam vanished and passed down the hill , less than a rustle of the wind . 
 The others remained long by the river - side . For some time others had been silent , moving restlessly about ; but now others were sitting in a circle , and others were talking . Every now and again others made efforts to speak of other things , of others long road and many adventures ; others questioned Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and realm ancient history , and the remnants of realm great works that could still be seen in this strange border - land of the Emyn Muil : the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen , and the great Stair beside the falls of Rauros . But always others thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo and the Ring . What would Frodo choose to do ? Why was Rauros hesitating ? 
 ‘ Rauros is debating which course is the most desperate , I think , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ And well Rauros may . It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company to go east , since we have been tracked by Gollum , and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed . But Minas Tirith is no nearer to the Fire and the destruction of the Burden . 
 ‘ We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand ; but the Lord Denethor and all Tirith men can not hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond Tirith power : either to keep the Burden secret , or to hold off the full might of the Enemy when Tirith comes to take secret . Which way would any of us choose in Frodo ’s place ? I do not know . Now indeed we miss Gandalf most . ’ 
 ‘ Grievous is our loss , ’ said Legolas . ‘ Yet we must needs make up our minds without Gandalf aid . Why can not we decide , and so help Frodo ? Let us call Gandalf back and then vote ! I should vote for Minas Tirith . ’ 
 ‘ And so should I , ’ said Gimli . ‘ We , of course , were only sent to help the Bearer along the road , to go no further than we wished ; and none of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom . Hard was my parting from Lothlórien . Yet I have come so far , and I say this : now we have reached the last choice , it is clear to me that I can not leave Frodo . I would choose Minas Tirith , but if Tirith does not , then I follow Tirith . ’ 
 ‘ And I too will go with Tirith , ’ said Legolas . ‘ It would be faithless now to say farewell . ’ 
 ‘ It would indeed be a betrayal , if we all left Tirith , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ But if Tirith goes east , then all need not go with Tirith ; nor do I think that all should . That venture is desperate : as much so for eight as for three or two , or one alone . If you would let me choose , then I should appoint three companions : Sam , who could not bear venture otherwise ; and Gimli ; and myself . Boromir will return to Sam own city , where Sam father and Sam people need Sam ; and with Sam the others should go , or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin , if Legolas is not willing to leave us . ’ 
 ‘ That wo n’t do at all ! ’ cried Merry . ‘ We ca n’t leave Frodo ! Pippin and I always intended to go wherever Sam went , and we still do . But we did not realize what that would mean . It seemed different so far away , in the Shire or in Rivendell . It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor . Why ca n’t we stop Frodo ? ’ 
 ‘ We must stop Mordor , ’ said Pippin . ‘ And that is what Mordor is worrying about , I am sure . Mordor knows we sha n’t agree to Mordor going east . And Mordor does n’t like to ask anyone to go with Frodo , poor old fellow . Imagine fellow : going off to Mordor alone ! ’ Pippin shuddered . ‘ But the dear silly old hobbit , Frodo ought to know that Frodo has n’t got to ask . Frodo ought to know that if we ca n’t stop Frodo , we sha n’t leave Frodo . ’ 
 ‘ Begging your pardon , ’ said Sam . ‘ I do n’t think you understand my master at all . Frodo is n’t hesitating about which way to go . Of course not ! What ’s the good of Minas Tirith anyway ? To Frodo , I mean , begging your pardon , Master Boromir , ’ Sam added , and turned . It was then that Boromir discovered that Boromir , who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle , was no longer there . 
 ‘ Now where ’s Frodo got to ? ’ cried Sam , looking worried . ‘ Sam ’s been a bit queer lately , to my mind . But anyway Sam ’s not in this business . Sam ’s off to Sam home , as Sam always said ; and no blame to Frodo . But Mr. Frodo , Frodo knows Frodo ’s got to find the Cracks of Doom , if Frodo can . But Frodo ’s afraid . Now Doom ’s come to the point , Frodo ’s just plain terrified . That ’s what Frodo trouble is . Of course Frodo ’s had a bit of schooling , so to speak – we all have – since we left home , or Frodo ’d be so terrified Frodo ’d just fling the Ring in the River and bolt . But Frodo ’s still too frightened to start . And Frodo is n’t worrying about us either : whether we ’ll go along with Frodo or no . Frodo knows we mean to . That ’s another thing that ’s bothering Frodo . If Frodo screws Frodo up to go , Frodo ’ll want to go alone . Mark my words ! We ’re going to have trouble when Frodo comes back . For Frodo ’ll screw Frodo up all right , as sure as Frodo name ’s Baggins . ’ 
 ‘ I believe you speak more wisely than any of us , Sam , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ And what shall we do , if you prove right ? ’ 
 ‘ Stop Frodo ! Do n’t let Frodo go ! ’ cried Pippin . 
 ‘ I wonder ? ’ said Aragorn . ‘ Frodo is the Bearer , and the fate of the Burden is on Frodo . I do not think that it is our part to drive Frodo one way or the other . Nor do I think that we should succeed , if we tried . There are other powers at work far stronger . ’ 
 ‘ Well , I wish Frodo would “ screw Frodo up ” and come back , and let us get work over , ’ said Pippin . ‘ This waiting is horrible ! Surely the time is up ? ’ 
 ‘ Yes , ’ said Aragorn . ‘ The hour is long passed . The morning is wearing away . We must call for Aragorn . ’ 
 At that moment Boromir reappeared . Aragorn came out from the trees and walked towards trees without speaking . Aragorn face looked grim and sad . Aragorn paused as if counting those that were present , and then sat down aloof , with Aragorn eyes on the ground . 
 ‘ Where have you been , Boromir ? ’ asked Aragorn . ‘ Have you seen Frodo ? ’ 
 Boromir hesitated for a second . ‘ Yes , and no , ’ Aragorn answered slowly . ‘ Yes : I found Frodo some way up the hill , and I spoke to Frodo . I urged Frodo to come to Minas Tirith and not to go east . I grew angry and Frodo left me . Frodo vanished . I have never seen such a thing happen before , though I have heard of thing in tales . Frodo must have put the Ring on . I could not find Frodo again . I thought Frodo would return to you . ’ 
 ‘ Is that all that you have to say ? ’ said Aragorn , looking hard and not too kindly at Boromir . 
 ‘ Yes , ’ Aragorn answered . ‘ I will say no more yet . ’ 
 ‘ This is bad ! ’ cried Sam , jumping up . ‘ I do n’t know what this Sam has been up to . Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on ? Frodo did n’t ought to have ; and if Frodo has , goodness knows what may have happened ! ’ 
 ‘ But Frodo would n’t keep goodness on , ’ said Merry . ‘ Not when Frodo had escaped the unwelcome visitor , like Bilbo used to . ’ 
 ‘ But where did Frodo go ? Where is Frodo ? ’ cried Pippin . ‘ Frodo ’s been away ages now . ’ 
 ‘ How long is it since you saw Frodo last , Boromir ? ’ asked Aragorn . 
 ‘ Half an hour , maybe , ’ Aragorn answered . ‘ Or goodness might be an hour . I have wandered for some time since . I do not know ! I do not know ! ’ Aragorn put Aragorn head in Aragorn hands , and sat as if bowed with grief . 
 ‘ An hour since Aragorn vanished ! ’ shouted Sam . ‘ We must try and find Aragorn at once . Come on ! ’ 
 ‘ Wait a moment ! ’ cried Aragorn . ‘ We must divide up into pairs , and arrange – here , hold on ! Wait ! ’ 
 head was no good . hands took no notice of Aragorn . Sam had dashed off first . Merry and Pippin had followed , and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore , shouting : Frodo ! Frodo ! in hands clear , high , hobbit - voices . Legolas and Gimli were running . A sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the Company . 
 ‘ We shall all be scattered and lost , ’ groaned Aragorn . ‘ Boromir ! I do not know what part you have played in this mischief , but help now ! Go after those two young hobbits , and guard hobbits at the least , even if you can not find Frodo . Come back to this spot , if you find Frodo , or any traces of Frodo . I shall return soon . ’ 
 Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam . Just as Aragorn reached the little lawn among the rowans Sam overtook Sam , toiling uphill , panting and calling , Frodo ! 
 ‘ Come with me , Sam ! ’ Sam said . ‘ None of us should be alone . There is mischief about . I feel mischief . I am going to the top , to the Seat of Amon Hen , to see what may be seen . And look ! It is as my heart guessed , Frodo went this way . Follow me , and keep your eyes open ! ’ Frodo sped up the path . 
 Sam did Sam best , but Sam could not keep up with Strider the Ranger , and soon fell behind . Sam had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead . Sam stopped and puffed . Suddenly Sam clapped Sam hand to Sam head . 
 ‘ Whoa , Sam Gamgee ! ’ Sam said aloud . ‘ Your legs are too short , so use your head ! Let me see now ! Boromir is n’t lying , that ’s not Boromir way ; but Boromir has n’t told us everything . Something scared Mr. Frodo badly . Boromir screwed Boromir up to the point , sudden . Boromir made up Boromir mind at last – to go . Where to ? Off East . Not without Sam ? Yes , without even Boromir Sam . That ’s hard , cruel hard . ’ 
 Sam passed Sam hand over Sam eyes , brushing away the tears . ‘ Steady , Gamgee ! ’ Sam said . ‘ Think , if you can ! Boromir ca n’t fly across rivers , and Boromir ca n’t jump waterfalls . Boromir ’s got no gear . So Boromir ’s got to get back to the boats . Back to the boats ! Back to the boats , Sam , like lightning ! ’ 
 Sam turned and bolted back down the path . Sam fell and cut Sam knees . Up Sam got and ran on . Sam came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the shore , where the boats were drawn up out of the water . No one was there . There seemed to be cries in the woods behind , but Sam did not heed woods . Sam stood gazing for a moment , stock - still , gaping . A boat was sliding down the bank all by boat . With a shout Sam raced across the grass . The boat slipped into the water . 
 ‘ Coming , Mr. Frodo ! Coming ! ’ called Sam , and flung Sam from the bank , clutching at the departing boat . Sam missed bank by a yard . With a cry and a splash Sam fell face downward into deep swift water . Gurgling Sam went under , and the River closed over Sam curly head . 
 An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat . A paddle swirled and the boat put about . Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as Frodo came up , bubbling and struggling . Fear was staring in Frodo round brown eyes . 
 ‘ Up you come , Sam my lad ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ Now take my hand ! ’ 
 ‘ Save me , Mr. Frodo ! ’ gasped Sam . ‘ I ’m drownded . I ca n’t see your hand . ’ 
 ‘ Here hand is . Do n’t pinch , lad ! I wo n’t let you go . Tread water and do n’t flounder , or you ’ll upset the boat . There now , get hold of the side , and let me use the paddle ! ’ 
 With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank , and Sam was able to scramble out , wet as a water - rat . Frodo took off the Ring and stepped ashore again . 
 ‘ Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst , Sam ! ’ Sam said . 
 ‘ Oh , Mr. Frodo , that ’s hard ! ’ said Sam shivering . ‘ That ’s hard , trying to go without me and all . If I had n’t a guessed right , where would you be now ? ’ 
 ‘ Safely on my way . ’ 
 ‘ Safely ! ’ said Sam . ‘ All alone and without me to help you ? I could n’t have a borne way , it ’d have been the death of me . ’ 
 ‘ It would be the death of you to come with me , Sam , ’ said Frodo , ‘ and I could not have borne that . ’ 
 ‘ Not as certain as being left behind , ’ said Sam . 
 ‘ But I am going to Mordor . ’ 
 ‘ I know that well enough , Mr. Frodo . Of course you are . And I ’m coming with you . ’ 
 ‘ Now , Sam , ’ said Frodo , ‘ do n’t hinder me ! The others will be coming back at any minute . If others catch me here , I shall have to argue and explain , and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off . But I must go at once . heart ’s the only way . ’ 
 ‘ Of course heart is , ’ answered Sam . ‘ But not alone . I ’m coming too , or neither of us is n’t going . I ’ll knock holes in all the boats first . ’ 
 Frodo actually laughed . A sudden warmth and gladness touched Sam heart . ‘ Leave one ! ’ Sam said . ‘ We ’ll need one . But you ca n’t come like this without your gear or food or anything . ’ 
 ‘ Just hold on a moment , and I ’ll get my stuff ! ’ cried Sam eagerly . ‘ one ’s all ready . I thought we should be off today . ’ Sam rushed to the camping place , fished out Sam pack from the pile where Frodo had laid pack when Sam emptied the boat of Sam companions ’ goods , grabbed a spare blanket , and some extra packages of food , and ran back . 
 ‘ So all my plan is spoilt ! ’ said Frodo . ‘ It is no good trying to escape you . But I ’m glad , Sam . I can not tell you how glad . Come along ! It is plain that we were meant to go together . We will go , and may the others find a safe road ! Strider will look after others . I do n’t suppose we shall see others again . ’ 
 ‘ Yet we may , Mr. Frodo . We may , ’ said Sam . 
 So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together . Frodo paddled away from the shore , and the River bore Sam swiftly away , down the western arm , and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir . The roar of the great falls drew nearer . Even with such help as Sam could give , it was hard work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore . 
 At length Sam came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon Lhaw . There Sam found a shelving shore , and Sam drew the boat out , high above the water , and hid boat as well as Sam could behind a great boulder . Then shouldering Sam burdens , Sam set off , seeking a path that would bring Sam over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil , and down into the Land of Shadow .
